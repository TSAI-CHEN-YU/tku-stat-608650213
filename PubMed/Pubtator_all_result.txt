10493257|t|CYP1A1.
10493257|a|CYP1A1 plays an important role in the metabolism of polycyclic hydrocarbons that occur in the environment and several studies suggest that the genetic polymorphism of the gene may play a role in the predisposition to cancer. In order to evaluate the function of CYP1A1 in vivo as a host factor determinant of environmentally-caused cancers in humans, additional investigations are needed involving not only molecular epidemiological approaches in different ethnic populations but also more direct approaches such as the use of gene-targeted mice as a model system.

10493258|t|Human cytochrome P4501A2.
10493258|a|CYP1A2, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily (CYPs), is involved in the metabolic activation of several carcinogens, among them aromatic and heterocyclic amines, nitroaromatic compounds, mycotoxins and estrogens. Several drugs are also metabolized by CYP1A2. Individual differences in CYP1A2 activity may thus influence individual susceptibility to cancer risk and the therapeutic efficacy of some drugs. In humans, CYP1A2 has been detected only in the liver, where it seems to be regulated by at least two mechanisms, one controlling constitutive levels of expression and another regulating inducibility. Wide interindividual differences in CYP1A2 activity have been described. They may be due to factors such as gender, race, genetic polymorphisms, and exposure to inducers. Higher activity has been shown in men than in women. Wide variation across racial/ethnic groups has been reported. Overall, slow and intermediate CYP1A2 metabolizers represent about 50% of Caucasians, while their frequency in Japanese subjects seems to be much lower. No nucleotide differences that could explain the phenotypic variability of the CYP1A2 gene have been found in any exons, exon-intron junctions, or 5'-flanking regions of the gene. However, two genetic variants have been identified which seem to be associated with CYP1A2 inducibility only. Induction of CYP1A2 activity has been reported as a consequence of cigarette smoking, dietary factors, several drugs, chronic hepatitis, and exposure to polybrominated biphenyls and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. Several epidemiological studies have been conducted into the relationship between CYP1A2 activity, alone or in combination with other CYPs, and cancer risk. In the absence of a genotypic assay, only the CYP1A2 phenotype can be assessed at present. Many compounds have been tested as in vitro probes to assess CYP1A2 activity in humans. Currently, caffeine has the best potential for use in epidemiological studies: metabolites of caffeine after coffee consumption are measured as an index of CYP1A2 activity. Variable results have been obtained with caffeine-based methods, the use of some caffeine metabolite ratios having given bimodal or trimodal distributions while others have suggested normal or unimodal distributions. Although the epidemiological studies are limited because only phenotyping data are available, there is a suggestion of increased risk of colon cancer and bladder cancer in subjects with rapid CYP1A2 activity. A higher level of 4-aminobiphenyl-haemoglobin adducts has also been found in moderate smokers with rapid CYP1A2 phenotype than in subjects with slow activity.

9929717|t|Ethics and genetic testing.
9929717|a|The tremendous growth in knowledge about genes and genetic technologies will eventually enable us to know individual genotypes and susceptibilities to disease, perhaps even before birth. Each new genetic test developed raises serious issues for individuals and society on the circumstances under which genetic information should be sought and the uses that should be made of such information. Ethical reflection and analysis will help us to prepare for the responsible use of information about genotypes so that individuals, both now and in the future, are benefited and not harmed, so that justice is served, and so that confidentiality and privacy, and respect for the autonomy, dignity, and differences of each individual, are preserved.

10418710|t|Hereditary cancer.
10418710|a|Cancer cases are often clustered in certain families and pedigree analysis indicates that at least 5% of cancer patients have a genetic predisposition to the disease. During the past decade the basic mechanisms for hereditary cancer have been outlined and a large number of the genes involved have been identified. This rapid development has changed the clinical management of cancer families, which now includes surveillance programs directed to early diagnosis of tumors as well as predictive mutation testing to identify gene carriers. This review outlines the molecular basis for hereditary cancer that has become the basis for genetic counseling of cancer families. The organization of clinics for cancer families in Sweden and the clinical implications of surveillance programs and gene testing for cancer predisposition are discussed.

9636179|t|Identification of novel susceptibility loci for inflammatory bowel disease on chromosomes 1p, 3q, and 4q: evidence for epistasis between 1p and IBD1.
9636179|a|The idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic, frequently disabling diseases of the intestines. Segregation analyses, twin concordance, and ethnic differences in familial risks have established that CD and UC are complex, non-Mendelian, related genetic disorders. We performed a genome-wide screen using 377 autosomal markers, on 297 CD, UC, or mixed relative pairs from 174 families, 37% Ashkenazim. We observed evidence for linkage at 3q for all families (multipoint logarithm of the odds score (MLod) = 2.29, P = 5.7 x 10(-4)), with greatest significance for non-Ashkenazim Caucasians (MLod = 3.39, P = 3.92 x 10(-5)), and at chromosome 1p (MLod = 2.65, P = 2.4 x 10(-4)) for all families. In a limited subset of mixed families (containing one member with CD and another with UC), evidence for linkage was observed on chromosome 4q (MLod = 2.76, P = 1.9 x 10(-4)), especially among Ashkenazim. There was confirmatory evidence for a CD locus, overlapping IBD1, in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 16 (MLod = 1.69, P = 2.6 x 10(-3)), particularly among Ashkenazim (MLod = 1.51, P = 7.8 x 10(-3)); however, positive MLod scores were observed over a very broad region of chromosome 16. Furthermore, evidence for epistasis between IBD1 and chromosome 1p was observed. Thirteen additional loci demonstrated nominal (MLod > 1.0, P < 0.016) evidence for linkage. This screen provides strong evidence that there are several major susceptibility loci contributing to the genetic risk for CD and UC.

10190270|t|Genetic susceptibility to neurodevelopmental disorders.
10190270|a|A large body of evidence suggests that genetic factors influence liability to many common neurodevelopmental disorders. Examples include Tourette syndrome, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, and dyslexia. Characterization of the genetic component of susceptibility to these conditions at a molecular level should improve classification, elucidate fundamental neurobiologic mechanisms of disease, and suggest novel approaches to treatment. Susceptibility loci for complex traits could be identified by detecting linkage to a well-mapped genetic marker or by detecting association with a putative high-risk allele at a candidate locus. This article reviews the principles underlying these complementary approaches, and notes recent progress in specific conditions. As the molecular epidemiology of susceptibility to common neurodevelopmental disorders emerges, it might be increasingly possible to identify "high-risk" and "low-risk" genotypes. Clinicians should understand the nature of this kind of information in order to appreciate its power as well as its limitations.

10919137|t|[Genetics of dystonia].
10919137|a|To date, at least 12 types of primary dystonia can be distinguished on a genetic basis. A 3-bp deletion in the DYT1 gene causes early onset, generalized torsion dystonia (TD), and mutations in the GTP cyclohydrolase I and the tyrosine hydroxylase genes result in dopa-responsive dystonia (DYT5). A missense change in the D2 dopamine receptor in one large family (DYT11) has recently been implicated in myoclonus-dystonia. Furthermore, seven other loci for dystonia genes have been mapped to chromosomal regions, including a locus for a mixed dystonia phenotype (DYT6), one form of focal dystonia (DYT7), three types of paroxysmal dystonia (DYT8-10), X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (DYT3), and rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (DYT12). No positive linkage results have yet been obtained for autosomal recessive TD (DYT2) and several other families of different types of dominantly inherited TD (DYT4). In addition, hereditary secondary dystonia may occur as part of familial diseases of the basal ganglia, metabolic and storage disorders, and various X-linked and other familial neurodegenerative syndromes affecting the basal ganglia. It may be anticipated that the traditional clinical and etiological classifications of dystonia will increasingly be replaced by a genetic one and that the identification of more dystonia genes may lead to a better understanding of these largely nondegenerative disorders.

9646043|t|Genes and the environment: their impact on children's health.
9646043|a|Because the human population is biologically diverse and genetically heterogeneous, it is not surprising that differences in susceptibility to disease among individuals with or without exposure to environmental agents exist. Individuals vary greatly in their susceptibility to disease. This is true of adults and children. The etiologies of many diseases of childhood are due to a combination of factors, including genetic susceptibility and environmental exposures during vulnerable periods of development. Genes regulate cellular growth and development, DNA replication and repair, the metabolism of endogenous agents in the body, and the metabolism and excretion of exogenous agents that the body comes in contact with in the environment. This regulation varies over the life span, contributing to the cellular consequences of the environmental exposures. This paper summarizes the contributions of genetics in understanding the etiology of environmentally induced diseases in children. The use of biomarkers of genetic susceptibility in the study of these diseases will be discussed. Future research needs for expanding our knowledge of the interactions between genetic and environmental components of childhood diseases will be presented.

1892465|t|HLA population genetics.
1892465|a|The HLA system has been extensively studied from an evolutionary perspective. The region contains a number of closely linked genes whose products control a variety of functions concerned with the regulation of immune responses. In addition, the genetic predisposition to over 40 diseases maps to this region. A number of observations indicate that strong selection is acting on the HLA region, including its extensive polymorphism with very even allele frequencies, the preferential occurrence of high levels of variability at positions critical to antigen recognition, the great age of alleles and the patterns of linkage disequilibrium among loci. The form of the selection is unknown. Although balancing selection is a strong candidate, it seems unlikely that only one selective mechanism is operating in this complex multigene family region. Mutation, recombination and gene conversion all contribute to the generation of HLA variability. The apparent great age of many HLA alleles revealed by phylogenetic analysis suggests that the absolute rate of production of new variants is not high. Detailed studies of population and evolutionary features of the HLA region are necessary for an informed discussion of the evolution of disease predisposing genes and epitopes, and of complex multigene families.

10612493|t|Hereditary breast cancer.
10612493|a|Information on genetics is in process of exponential growth, with a corresponding recognition that most medical information, screening and diagnostic tests, and disease processes have a genetic component. Hereditary breast cancer is a good example, showing the complexity of cancer genetics in a clinical context. The contribution of family history to the risk of developing breast cancer has been appreciated for some time. Breast cancer was believed to be a result of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Today it is known that single genes are also responsible for breast cancer and some of these genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) can be identified by genetic testing. Genetic information on breast cancer is, however, still limited and although the tests that are now available can be beneficial, they also carry some risks and limitations.

Advances in molecular genetics are discussed in relation to the shifts in research strategies to investigate multifactorial disorders (affected relative linkage designs, association strategies, and quantitative trait loci studies); new techniques and identified genetic mechanisms (expansion of trinucleotide repeats, genomic imprinting, mitochondrial DNA, fluorescent in-situ hybridisation, behavioural phenotypes, and animal models); and the successful localisation of genes.

10882217|t|Mixed connective tissue disease: overlap syndromes.
10882217|a|Since the original description of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) as an apparently unique syndrome by Sharp and co-workers, the concept of MCTD has been highly controversial. In this chapter, a quarter of a decade later, we examine the evidence that MCTD is a distinctive entity rather than a haphazard association of clinical and serological features and that the presence of high titres of autoantibodies to UIRNP influences the expression of connective tissue disease in ways that are relevant to prognosis and treatment. Results of longterm clinical studies are presented, which show that the clinical phenotype of MCTD is robust and can be defined by classification criteria that show reasonable sensitivity and specificity. In addition, the chapter addresses the results of immunogenetic and serological studies that demonstrate that MCTD is quite distinctive from systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis. Indeed, there is good evidence that the clinical and serological features of MCTD are not just a haphazard association but that these patients represent a distinctive subset of connective tissue disease in which the specific autoimmune response is relevant to clinical expression and to understanding the underlying pathogenesis.

8091226|t|Genetic dissection of complex traits.
8091226|a|Medical genetics was revolutionized during the 1980s by the application of genetic mapping to locate the genes responsible for simple Mendelian diseases. Most diseases and traits, however, do not follow simple inheritance patterns. Genetics have thus begun taking up the even greater challenge of the genetic dissection of complex traits. Four major approaches have been developed: linkage analysis, allele-sharing methods, association studies, and polygenic analysis of experimental crosses. This article synthesizes the current state of the genetic dissection of complex traits--describing the methods, limitations, and recent applications to biological problems.

10464586|t|The psychological impact of genetic testing for Alzheimer disease.
10464586|a|Information regarding one's genetic risk for a particular disease might effectively inform medical, financial, and reproductive decisions and perhaps promote established risk reduction behaviors. However, genetic testing may also lead to significant levels of anxiety, depression, or other forms of distress, especially when psychological coping strategies and social reserves are not adequate to manage positive or inconclusive results. This paper focuses on the psychological impact of predisposition genetic for Alzheimer disease (AD). We present stress and coping models that capture the essence of this impact and discuss the potential role of counseling and follow-up interventions. The discussion draws primarily from the experiences of professionals working with other diseases, and seeks to expand that experience into the AD arena. In addition, we emphasize two issues we believe need additional attention in the psychological literature regarding genetic testing and counseling: (i) the psychosocial vulnerability of individuals being tested and, (ii) the sociocultural context of the AD patient and their family members.

10667461|t|Molecular genetics and epidemiology of the NAT1 and NAT2 acetylation polymorphisms.
10667461|a|The focus of this review is the molecular genetics, including consensus NAT1 and NAT2 nomenclature, and cancer epidemiology of the NAT1 and NAT2 acetylation polymorphisms. Two N-acetyltransferase isozymes, NAT1 and NAT2, are polymorphic and catalyze both N-acetylation (usually deactivation) and O-acetylation (usually activation) of aromatic and heterocyclic amine carcinogens. Epidemiological studies suggest that the NAT1 and NAT2 acetylation polymorphisms modify risk of developing urinary bladder, colorectal, breast, head and neck, lung, and possibly prostate cancers. Associations between slow NAT2 acetylator genotypes and urinary bladder cancer and between rapid NAT2 acetylator genotypes and colorectal cancer are the most consistently reported. The individual risks associated with NAT1 and/or NAT2 acetylator genotypes are small, but they increase when considered in conjunction with other susceptibility genes and/or aromatic and heterocyclic amine carcinogen exposures. Because of the relatively high frequency of some NAT1 and NAT2 genotypes in the population, the attributable cancer risk may be high. The effect of NAT1 and NAT2 genotype on cancer risk varies with organ site, probably reflecting tissue-specific expression of NAT1 and NAT2. Ethnic differences exist in NAT1 and NAT2 genotype frequencies that may be a factor in cancer incidence. Large-scale molecular epidemiological studies that investigate the role of NAT1 and NAT2 genotypes and/or phenotypes together with other genetic susceptibility gene polymorphisms and biomarkers of carcinogen exposure are necessary to expand our current understanding of the role of NAT1 and NAT2 acetylation polymorphisms in cancer risk.

10203734|a|The inherited palmoplantar keratodermas (PPKs) are a diverse and often clinically confusing branch of the genetic skin diseases. As the name suggests, the lesions of PPK primarily affect the palms and soles of the feet, although a number of the PPKs are also associated with a genetic predisposition to other conditions, including cancer, hearing loss and heart failure. The mapping and identification of genes that underlie the PPKs reveal new insights into the biological interactions of the structural components of the palmoplantar epidermis and further our understanding of epidermal disease. More significantly, by genetically characterizing the PPKs, genes that have a role in life-threatening disorders might also be identified.

10026992|t|Molecular epidemiology of environmental carcinogenesis.
10026992|a|Environmental factors such as smoking, diet, and pollutants act in concert with individual susceptibility to cause most human cancers. This article briefly reviews molecular evidence that two types of susceptibility factors--common predisposing genetic traits and young age at exposure--convey heightened risk from certain exposures. Examples are drawn from molecular epidemiologic studies of common environmental carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and aromatic amines. Understanding of both genetic and acquired susceptibility in the population will be instrumental in developing health and regulatory policies that adequately protect of the more susceptible groups from risks of environmental carcinogens.

8666163|t|A polygenic model of inherited predisposition to cancer.
8666163|a|Polygenic inheritance of predisposition to cancer is demonstrated in experimental animals for different tumor types. Genetic susceptibility to hepatocarcinogenesis, lung tumorigenesis, skin and intestine carcinogenesis, and plasmacytomagenesis is determined by inheritance of multiple cancer predisposition and resistance alleles, whose chromosomal locations have been found by genetic linkage analysis. In some of these experimental models, genetic heterogeneity has also been reported. In humans, increased risk of lung cancer associated with multiple genes coding for drug metabolizing enzymes, increased risk of cancer in relatives of cancer patients, and genetic heterogeneity are compatible with polygenic inheritance of cancer predisposition. Polygenic inheritance based on the combination of multiple alleles that give predisposition and resistance to cancer would predict a very high risk of cancer in carrier individuals and a marginal increase in the relative risk of cancer in the progeny of the cancer patients. Therefore, predisposition to cancer may be genetically determined even in the absence of familial clustering of cases.

10939224|t|The genetics of childhood psychiatric disorders: a decade of progress.
10939224|a|OBJECTIVE: To review the literature over the past decade on the genetics of childhood neuropsychiatric disorders. METHOD: A computerized search was performed for articles published in the past decade, and selected papers were highlighted. RESULTS: The past decade of research has illuminated the complex genetics of early-onset mental disorders. Advances in statistical methodologies and laboratory-based gene-hunting techniques are laying the foundation for a deeper understanding of both the biological and environmental factors that contribute to mental illness. Researchers are on the verge of identifying and characterizing genetic vulnerabilities involved in common childhood psychiatric syndromes. CONCLUSIONS: Although the study of the genetics of childhood psychiatric disorders has advanced significantly over the past decade, considerable work remains. The identification of genes conferring vulnerability to psychiatric illnesses will have the potential to transform the field by providing insight into both biological and environmental determinants that contribute to serious developmental and psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. These advances promise new understanding and new avenues for prevention and treatment. They will also present physicians and families with significant clinical and ethical challenges.

10872430|t|Surgical management of hereditary pancreatic cancer.
10872430|a|Pancreatic cancer continues to be a leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Seven genetic syndromes are now known to be associated with an increased incidence of pancreatic cancer. Other familial forms of pancreatic cancer exist although the genetic basis for this predisposition remains elusive. The similarities in the genetic and clinical manifestations of the sporadic and familial forms of pancreatic cancer suggest that pretreatment staging and management of patients with established pancreatic cancer should be similar. For carcinomas of the pancreatic head, pancreaticoduodenectomy should be performed according to current surgical practice, whereas the use of total pancreatectomy should be limited to cases in which margins are found to be positive or if the anatomy precludes a safe pancreaticojejunostomy. Total pancreatectomy may be considered in high-risk kindreds who strongly desire prophylactic surgery and in those with premalignant lesions. Identification of the precise genetic basis for inherited pancreatic cancer will someday make it possible to examine scientifically the effectiveness of specific management strategies.

9949798|t|Host genetic susceptibility to human tuberculosis.
9949798|a|Convincing evidence exists that host genes influence the outcome of infection in human tuberculosis. We are employing two complementary strategies to find the genes involved: a linkage-based, comprehensive genome screen and an association-based candidate gene study. In a genome screen of 282 markers on 92 affected sib pairs we have found evidence of co-segregation of disease with five markers, but further studies are required to replicate these results. The absence of a single strongly linked marker demonstrates that susceptibility to human tuberculosis is not controlled by a single major gene. Using a candidate gene approach investigating over 400 tuberculosis cases and 400 ethnically matched healthy controls we have found evidence that NR AMP1 and vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) polymorphisms are associated with tuberculosis. It is hoped that by identifying the genes that account for why only a minority of those exposed to tuberculosis develop disease, we will develop new insights into potential therapeutic and preventative strategies.

10786964|t|Genetic dissection of the molecular pathogenesis of severe infection.
10786964|a|A fundamental question for the intensivist is why some individuals but not others succumb to life-threatening infection. A growing body of evidence indicates that both the risk of acquiring infection and the risk of developing severe complications are determined by host genetic factors. These include a number of single gene defects with devastating consequences, e. g. interferon-gamma receptor mutations that lead to fatal infections with ubiquitous mycobacteria, but such examples are relatively rare. Of greater importance for routine clinical practice is the potentially vast number of genetic variants with subtle effects on the regulation or function of specific immunological, physiological and metabolic mediators. Such polygenic traits do not obey simple patterns of familial segregation seen for monogenic disorders, and their clinical investigation is further complicated by the environmental variability of infectious exposure. Recent advances in this field have therefore largely stemmed from hospital-based case-controlled studies that have uncovered disease associations with specific DNA polymorphisms in candidate gene regions. For example, tumour necrosis factor polymorphisms have been associated with susceptibility to malaria and other infections; chemokine receptor polymorphisms with susceptibility to HIV; natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 with tuberculosis; and mannose binding lectin polymorphisms with meningococcal disease. A much greater number of genetic associations will emerge as the full extent of human genomic diversity becomes known. The challenge for clinical investigators is to generate an epidemiological framework for population- and family-based association studies, which is sufficiently robust to exclude population artifacts and sufficiently powerful to be able to dissect true disease-causing polymorphisms from linked genetic markers. In the long term this approach promises to identify host mediators that are critical for pathogenesis and immunity and to yield molecular insights into the complex processes of human gene regulation. This information is likely to be of considerable value in designing more effective approaches to the treatment and prevention of life-threatening infectious disease.

803016|t|Ethnic variation in genetic disease: possible roles of hitchhiking and epistasis.
803016|a|The high incidence of some genetic diseases in certain ethnic groups is important in planning of medical genetic programs. Simple interaction models predict that at least some lethal recessive alleles will have "hitchhiked" to increased frequencies because of linkage to genes whose alleles have been favored by selection for other reasons in certain populations. In the absence of linkage or epistasis with a gene favored by selection, heterozygote advantage for a recessive lethal may produce the same phenomenon. In the hitchhiking model (linkage), the increase in the gene frequency is temporary, but the length of time that the increased gene frequency is at least double the base frequency may be quite long. Changes in gene frequency for the unlinked epistatic model result in a new equilibrium with a possibly higher gene frequency. The most likely chromosomal regions in which hitchhiked lethal recessives would be found are in the vicinity of genes whose allelic frequencies vary substantially among human racial groups (e.g., Gm, Rh, Duffy, lactose tolerance, or HL-A). There will be a hitchhiking effect if recombination distance is less than the selective advantage. The closer the linkage of two loci, the easier hitchhiking effects will be to detect. Hitchhiking is suggested by nonrandom association of the recessive disease and one of the selected markers, as in the case of Gm and cystic fibrosis. However, there is so far insufficient evidence of linkage between them. More pedigree information is necessary than is now available.

11030482|t|The implications of genetics studies of major mood disorders for clinical practice.
11030482|a|BACKGROUND: This article is a selective review and synthesis of relevant research findings from genetic studies of major mood disorders and the application of these to clinical practice. METHOD: The article discusses the application of genetic research findings in major mood disorders, including epidemiologic and family study risk estimates, risk modifiers, and the concepts of etiologic and phenotypic heterogeneity, to 3 clinical domains: risk counseling, diagnosis, and treatment prediction. RESULTS: Epidemiologic and family studies have provided general risk estimates useful in counseling mood-disordered patients and their relatives. A complete and accurate family pedigree provides more individualized risk estimates for specific cases and is useful in identifying the phenotypic spectrum of the disorder being transmitted in the family. Both proband course parameters and familial loading for psychiatric illnesses may be relevant for the prediction of treatment response. However, the hypothesis of inherited pharmacologic selectivity remains to be proven. CONCLUSION: Genetic studies of mood disorders have not yet provided conclusive evidence of specific susceptibility genes or their pattern of inheritance. However, they have generated information that is useful to clinical practice.

10885164|t|The genetics of mental illness: implications for practice.
10885164|a|Many of the comfortable and relatively simple models of the nature of mental disorders, their causes and their neural substrates now appear quite frayed. Gone is the idea that symptom clusters, course of illness, family history and treatment response would coalesce in a simple way to yield valid diagnoses. Also too simple was the concept, born of early pharmacological successes, that abnormal levels of one or more neurotransmitters would satisfactorily explain the pathogenesis of depression or schizophrenia. Gone is the notion that there is a single gene that causes any mental disorder or determines any behavioural variant. The concept of the causative gene has been replaced by that of genetic complexity, in which multiple genes act in concert with non-genetic factors to produce a risk of mental disorder. Discoveries in genetics and neuroscience can be expected to lead to better models that provide improved representation of the complexity of the brain and behaviour and the development of both. There are likely to be profound implications for clinical practice. The complex genetics of risk should reinvigorate research on the epidemiology and classification of mental disorders and explain the complex patterns of disease transmission within families. Knowledge of the timing of the expression of risk genes during brain development and of their function should not only contribute to an understanding of gene action and the pathophysiology of disease but should also help to direct the search for modifiable environmental risk factors that convert risk into illness. The function of risk genes can only become comprehensible in the context of advances at the molecular, cellular and systems levels in neuroscience and the behavioural sciences. Genetics should yield new therapies aimed not just at symptoms but also at pathogenic processes, thus permitting the targeting of specific therapies to individual patients.

10434024|t|Ionizing radiation and genetic risks. X. The potential "disease phenotypes" of radiation-induced genetic damage in humans: perspectives from human molecular biology and radiation genetics.
10434024|a|Estimates of genetic risks of radiation exposure of humans are traditionally expressed as expected increases in the frequencies of genetic diseases (single-gene, chromosomal and multifactorial) over and above those of naturally-occurring ones in the population. An important assumption in expressing risks in this manner is that gonadal radiation exposures can cause an increase in the frequency of mutations and that this would result in an increase in the frequency of genetic diseases under study. However, despite compelling evidence for radiation-induced mutations in experimental systems, no increases in the frequencies of genetic diseases of concern or other adverse effects (i.e., those which are not formally classified as genetic diseases), have been found in human studies involving parents who have sustained radiation exposures. The known differences between spontaneous mutations that underlie naturally-occurring single-gene diseases and radiation-induced mutations studied in experimental systems now permit us to address and resolve these issues to some extent. The fact that spontaneous mutations (among which are point mutations and DNA deletions generally restricted to the gene) originate through a number of different mechanisms and that the latter are intimately related to the DNA organization of the genes, are now well-documented. Further, spontaneous mutations include those that cause diseases through loss of function as well as gain of function of genes. In contrast, most radiation-induced mutations studied in experimental systems (although identified through the phenotypes of the marker genes) are predominantly multigene deletions which cause loss of function; the recoverability of an induced deletion in a livebirth seems dependent on whether the gene and the genomic region in which it is located can tolerate heterozygosity for the deletion and yet be compatible with viability. In retrospect, the successful mutation test systems (such as the mouse specific locus test) used in radiation studies have involved genes which are non-essential for survival and are also located in genomic regions, likewise non-essential for survival. In contrast, most of the human genes at which induced mutations have been looked for, do not seem to have these attributes. The inference therefore is that the failure to find induced germline mutations in humans is not due to the resistance of human genes to induced mutations but due to the structural and functional constraints associated with their recoverability in livebirths. Since the risk of inducible genetic diseases in humans is estimated using rates of "recovered" mutations in mice, there is a need to introduce appropriate correction factors to bridge the gap between these rates and the rates at which mutations causing diseases are potentially recoverable in humans. Since the whole genome is the "target" for radiation-induced genetic damage, the failure to find increases in the frequencies of specific single-gene diseases of societal concern does not imply that there are no genetic risks of radiation exposures: the problem lies in delineating the phenotypes of recoverable genetic damage that are recognizable in livebirths. Data from studies of naturally-occurring microdeletion syndromes in humans and those from mouse radiation studies are instructive in this regard. They (i) support the view that growth retardation, mental retardation and multisystem developmental abnormalities are likely to be among the quantitatively more important adverse effects of radiation-induced genetic damage than mutations in a few selected genes and (ii) underscore the need to expand the focus in risk estimation from known genetic diseases (as has been the case thus far) to include these induced adverse developmental effects although most of these are not formally classified as "genetic diseases".

11035981|t|Genetic approaches to the study of uterine leiomyomata.
11035981|a|The use of a variety of genetic methods to dissect underlying molecular events in tumors continues to be a highly successful approach. Cytogenetic evaluations of uterine leiomyomata have revealed consistent rearrangements that have provided biological landmarks for positional cloning experiments. Genetic linkage analysis makes possible the identification of genes that might predispose women to develop myomas. New gene expression chip methods to study globally the transcripts present in uterine leiomyomata promise insight into molecular pathways in tumor biology.

10509171|t|22q11 deletion syndrome: a genetic subtype of schizophrenia.
10509171|a|Schizophrenia is likely to be caused by several susceptibility genes and may have environmental factors that interact with susceptibility genes and/or nongenetic causes. Recent evidence supports the likelihood that 22q11 Deletion Syndrome (22qDS) represents an identifiable genetic subtype of schizophrenia. 22qDS is an under-recognized genetic syndrome associated with microdeletions on chromosome 22 and a variable expression that often includes mild congenital dysmorphic features, hypernasal speech, and learning difficulties. Initial evidence indicates that a minority of patients with schizophrenia (approximately 2%) may have 22qDS and that prevalence may be somewhat higher in subpopulations with developmental delay. This paper proposes clinical criteria (including facial features, learning disabilities, hypernasal speech, congenital heart defects and other congenital anomalies) to aid in identifying patients with schizophrenia who may have this subtype and outlines features that may increase the index of suspicion for this syndrome. Although no specific causal gene or genes have yet been identified in the deletion region, 22qDS may represent a more homogeneous subtype of schizophrenia. This subtype may serve as a model for neurodevelopmental origins of schizophrenia that could aid in delineating etiologic and pathogenetic mechanisms.

11656253|t|From the editors.
11656253|a|[T]here had been theories that homosexuality might have a genetic basis. In June this year, these theories received a somewhat firmer basis. Researchers at the United States National Cancer Institute reported new evidence which suggests that some gay men may have a genetic predisposition to homosexuality. The research team led by molecular biologist Dean Hamer tested 40 pairs of homosexual brothers and found that 33 of the pairs shared genetic markers on a particular area of the X chromosome (called Xq28), indicating a link between homosexuality and a gene in that area. If followed-up research were to confirm the findings, then, it has been claimed, this would be the first example of a behavioral trait that has been found to have a genetic basis. The study does, however, leave some central questions unanswered. Some revolve around the link between genetics and the nature of sexuality itself. The others concern the ethical and social implications of the research....

9839149|t|Genetic and environmental influences on drug use and abuse/dependence in male and female twins.
9839149|a|Twins were recruited through alcohol and drug treatment programs. With structural equation modeling, genetic and environmental estimates were obtained for use and DSM-III abuse/dependence of sedatives, opioids, cocaine, stimulants, and cannabis as well as any illicit drug. Analyses were conducted separately for males and females. Models included thresholds based on population prevalence of use or abuse/dependence and ever having been in treatment. Genetic influences were found for most measures. They were generally stronger for males than females and for clinical diagnoses of abuse/dependence compared to use. Common environmental influences played a greater role in use than abuse/dependence.

11122901|t|The genetics of schizophrenia.
11122901|a|Behavioral genetic studies provide overwhelming evidence that genes contribute to schizophrenia. Recently, genetic studies have provided promising evidence that schizophrenia genes are linked to several chromosomal locations in affected family members. Despite this progress, individual genes for schizophrenia have yet to be identified. Future progress will depend, in part, on the selection of phenotypes that best reflect effects of etiologic genes. One such phenotype is schizotaxia, a clinically meaningful syndrome that reflects the genetic liability to schizophrenia in nonpsychotic individuals. The potential importance of schizotaxia, or similar concepts, for use in genetic studies, is discussed.

7737047|t|Pharmacogenetics: detecting sensitive populations.
7737047|a|Risk assessment models strive to predict risks to humans from toxic agents. Safety factors and assumptions are incorporated into these models to allow a margin of error. In the case of cancer, substantial evidence shows that the carcinogenic process is a multistage process driven by the interaction of exogenous carcinogenic exposures, genetic traits, and other endogenous factors. Current risk assessment models fail to consider genetic predispositions that make people more sensitive or resistant to exogenous exposures and endogenous processes. Several cytochrome P450 enzymes, responsible for metabolically activating carcinogens and medications, express wide interindividual variation whose genetic coding has now been identified as polymorphic and linked to cancer risk. For example, a restriction fragment-length polymorphism for cytochrome P4501A1, which metabolizes polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and cytochrome P4502E1, which metabolizes N-nitrosamines and benzene, is linked to lung cancer risk. Cytochrome P4502D6, responsible for metabolizing many clinically important medications, also is linked to lung cancer risk. The frequency for each of these genetic polymorphisms vary among different ethnic and racial groups. In addition to inherited factors for the detection of sensitive populations, determining the biologically effective doses for carcinogenic exposures also should quantitatively and qualitatively enhance the risk assessment process. Levels of carcinogen-DNA adducts reflect the net effect of exposure, absorption, metabolic activation, detoxification, and DNA repair. These effects are genetically predetermined, inducibility notwithstanding. The combination of adduct and genotyping assays provide an assessment of risk that reflects recent exogenous exposure as well as one's lifetime ability to activate and detoxify carcinogens.

10332927|t|The Emerging Importance of Genetics in Epidemiologic Research III. Bioinformatics and statistical genetic methods.
10332927|a|PURPOSE: To outline potential benefits of integrating recent developments in bioinformatics and statistical genetics with traditional epidemiologic studies to localize genes influencing complex phenotypes and examine genetic effects on disease susceptibility. METHODS: An overview of bioinformatic and statistical approaches for localizing disease-susceptibility genes as well as challenges associated with identifying functional DNA variants and context-dependent genetic effects concludes this three-part series on the importance of genetics in epidemiologic research. RESULTS: Rapidly evolving bioinformatic and statistical methods are providing invaluable information on newly-discovered genes and molecular variation influencing human diseases that is readily available to epidemiologic researchers. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating bioinformatics and molecular biotechnology with epidemiologic methods of assessing disease risk is rapidly expanding our ability to identify genetic influences on complex human diseases. These technological advances are likely to have a profound impact on current knowledge of complex disease etiology, and may reveal novel approaches to disease treatment and prevention.

10934572|t|Genetics of the risk for alcoholism.
10934572|a|This paper reviews the literature on the importance of genetic influences in the development of alcohol abuse and dependence (alcoholism). The alcohol use disorders are fairly typical of most complex genetic conditions in that multiple genetic influences combine together to explain approximately 40% to 60% of the risk. One useful approach for identifying specific genes related to alcoholism involves identifying a population in which known genetic factors are controlled and using genome scan and/or case-control, association approaches to search for specific genes. Several characteristics, or endophenotypes, have been identified as both genetically influenced and contributing toward the risk for alcoholism, including alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, the low level of response to alcohol, and electrophysiological measures. The potential importance of each of these characteristics is reviewed, and data relating to the search for specific genetic material for each endophenotype are presented. These findings are placed in the perspective of the impact that they are likely to have on both prevention and treatment efforts in the alcohol field.

11129214|t|Drug and toxin-induced bile duct disorders.
11129214|a|Various drugs of toxins have been implicated in the development of a particular form of liver damage predominantly involving the bile ducts. Such liver toxicity is often associated with a clinical picture of prolonged cholestasis and may even evolve in rare instances, into the full picture of the vanishing bile duct syndrome, eventually complicated with biliary cirrhosis. Drug and toxins potentially responsible for bile duct injury are reviewed as well as the characteristics of its clinical presentation. The pathophysiologic aspects of the syndrome are also reviewed including recent data, which are strongly in favor of the role of a genetic predisposition.

10746909|t|Subthreshold symptoms and vulnerability indicators (e.g., eye tracking dysfunction) in schizophrenia.
10746909|a|Subthreshold symptoms in schizophrenia can be prodromal signs of a psychotic relapse. In people without schizophrenia, similar symptoms may indicate the presence of disorders termed schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Subthreshold schizophrenia-like symptoms may indicate a genetically transmitted higher proneness to schizophrenia. Such a higher liability to develop schizophrenia is ascertained on a symptom level. In genetic studies, asymptomatic members of a pedigree are therefore classified as unaffected although they may possess the genes in question. On a biological level, eye tracking dysfunction has been shown to fulfill certain criteria for a vulnerability indicator and therefore promises to offer more information on genetically transmitted proneness to schizophrenia even in people without psychopathological symptoms. Subthreshold symptoms may warrant treatment. The database for prophylactic treatment in populations at high risk, especially those without symptoms, is currently very small.

10791179|t|Genetics of colorectal cancer.
10791179|a|The multistep nature of cancer has been well-documented through molecular genetic studies of colorectal cancer. The information provided by basic, translational and clinical science highlighted several genes associated with different hereditary syndromes predisposing to colorectal cancer. Due to these and other findings, the molecular pathogenesis of this cancer has been clarified also with respect to genetic pathways which can lead to an otherwise undistinguishable disease. As a result of both the available and continuously added data, our knowledge and understanding of colorectal cancer is subject to constant changes. Ultimately, these are expected to result in multiple and strategical managements based on molecular genetics which will likely change our approach to this cancer in the incoming millennium.

10847329|a|The identification of genetic linkage between polymorphic markers and common kidney diseases, including focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis and diabetic nephropathy, clearly demonstrates that inherited factors contribute to renal failure susceptibility. These breakthroughs reveal the powerful contribution that molecular genetic techniques can make in the search for inherited factors that initiate renal failure and lead to its progression. Additionally, the environmental factors predisposing to nephropathy will be more readily detectable when evaluated in genetically similar populations. This manuscript reviews the developments in genetic epidemiology and molecular genetics of chronic renal failure.

10037550|t|The emerging importance of genetics in epidemiologic research II. Issues in study design and gene mapping.
10037550|a|PURPOSE: To provide a synthesis of current approaches to the discovery of genes associated with complex human diseases by examining the joint potential of traditional epidemiologic methods and current molecular techniques for gene discovery. METHODS: A discussion of optimal approaches for defining complex disease phenotypes in genetic epidemiology, ascertainment strategies for estimating genetic influences on disease risk, genomic approaches for localizing complex-disease-susceptibility genes, and the potential synergistic effects of integrating genetic and traditional epidemiologic expertise is provided in the second part of a three-part series on the importance of genetics in epidemiologic research. RESULTS: The ability to quantify genetic influences on disease risk appears highly dependent on the measurement of specific risk factor traits, ascertainment strategies for recruiting study subjects, and a variety of genomic approaches that are rapidly facilitating our ability to identify genes influencing inherited human diseases and to quantify genetic influences on disease risk. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating population-based methods of assessing disease risk with human genetics and genome technology is critical for identifying genetic polymorphisms that influence risk of disease and for defining genetic effects on complex disease etiology.

10570679|t|The genetic revolution: change and challenge for the dietetics profession.
10570679|a|Advances in genetics are occurring at a pace that challenges our ability to understand and respond to the implications. Soon we will be able to define more precisely the molecular mechanisms underlying human health and disease; subdivide diseases and conditions (e.g., obesity) that are clinically indistinguishable into more distinct entities, thereby improving our ability to choose rational preventive and treatment measures; identify genotypic markers that predict metabolic responses to dietary interventions; stratify the population into groups at higher or lower risk for chronic diseases such as cancer, thus allowing dietary intervention to be appropriately targeted; and develop dietary recommendations that take into account genetically determined taste preferences. Dietetics leaders, teachers, practitioners, and researchers must act now to ensure that dietetics professionals are prepared for practice in this new era. In this article we introduce the Human Genome Project, review the fundamentals of molecular genetics, discuss genetics and disease risk, and define and give examples of diet-gene interactions. We also discuss issues relevant to dietary counseling of healthy people with genetic susceptibility to chronic disease. To foster the growth of knowledge regarding this new biology among dietitians, The American Dietetic Association should take the following steps: require course work on diet-gene interactions and include human genetics as a topic area on dietetic registration examinations, form a practice group on this topic, develop an Internet-based communication and information hub for dietetics professionals, sponsor a session on human genetics at annual meetings, begin a dialogue regarding a new practice specialty in diet and genetic counseling, and encourage a health care system in which personal counseling on diet-gene interactions is valued and reimbursed.

10627090|t|Pharmacogenetics of responses to alcohol and genes that influence alcohol drinking.
10627090|a|OBJECTIVE: There is now compelling evidence for genetic influence on susceptibility to alcoholism. This article presents results from studies qualifying alcoholism as a pharmacogenetic disorder of the brain. METHOD: Studies from the author's research group and other investigators, of human subjects and experimental animal models, are reviewed. Included are experiments on the pharmacogenetics (elimination and metabolism) and pharmacodynamics (initial response, tolerance and dependence) of ethanol. RESULTS: Studies in humans have reliably shown that the genes for the principal enzymes of alcohol metabolism influence drinking behavior and alcoholism risk. Notably, the functional genetic variants of alcohol dehydrogenase that exhibit high alcohol oxidizing activity, and the genetic variant of aldehyde dehydrogenase that exhibits low acetaldehyde oxidizing activity, protect against heavy drinking and alcoholism. Extensive studies of inbred and selectively bred experimental rodent models with alcohol drinking preference, tolerance development and alcohol withdrawal susceptibility have shown strong genetic influence on these responses to ethanol. Neuroanatomical, neurochemical and genetic studies have shown the involvement of serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid and opioid pathways in these actions of ethanol. Genetic studies, including association and genome-wide survey studies in both humans and rodents, implicate serotonin 1b receptor, dopamine D2 receptor, tryptophan hydroxylase and neuropeptide Y as candidate targets of genetic susceptibility in these pharmacodynamic actions of ethanol. CONCLUSIONS: There are genetic predisposing factors for alcoholism. Nonspecific susceptibility factors include personality traits characterized by behavioral inhibition (e.g., novelty-seeking and impulsivity). These genetically influenced traits interact with other, also genetically influenced, traits involved in the metabolism and pharmacodynamic effects of alcohol, and this interaction forms the basis for nominating alcoholism as a pharmacogenetic disease. Clearly, there are also many environmental factors that influence drinking behavior. Individuals have different sets of susceptibility genes and experience different kinds of environmental provocation. These factors underlie the heterogeneity and complexity of the clinical phenotype of alcoholism.

10829052|t|Cancer risk and low-penetrance susceptibility genes in gene-environment interactions.
10829052|a|PURPOSE: To provide a concise review for human cancer risk related to low-penetrance genes and their effects on environmental carcinogen exposure. METHODS: Citation of relevant and recent references for molecular epidemiology, focusing on lung cancer, ethical issues, and some clinical implications of recent molecular epidemiology studies. RESULTS: Low-penetrance genes contribute to cancer risk by augmenting the effects of carcinogen exposures. These exposures can be measured in the body through molecular dosimetry (ie, the amount of DNA damage), which reflects a biologically effective dose. The examination of tumors and the mutations within tumor suppressor genes, such as p53, can provide etiologic clues for both exposure and susceptibility. Although many studies have focused on carcinogen metabolism and cancer risk, more recent studies are considering DNA repair. Also, we are learning that behavior, such as tobacco addiction, also may be genetically controlled. CONCLUSION: Sporadic cancers are caused by gene(n)-environment(n) interactions rather than a dominant effect by a specific gene, environmental exposure, or gene-environment interaction. New paradigms, where we categorize genes as caretaker or gatekeeper genes, will allow for new hypotheses to be tested and will require advanced methods of analysis. The goal of molecular epidemiology is to develop risk assessment models for individuals, but currently the most achievable goal will be population risk assessment and a better understanding of carcinogenesis.

10554472|t|The individual, the family, and genetic testing.
10554472|a|Genetics plays a role in every disease, yet few health care providers understand basic genetic principles or the science underlying the genetic testing process. An understanding of the science behind genetic advances is necessary, and it is equally important for health professionals to have an understanding of the complex nature of genetic testing for individuals and their families. Much of the debate about the psychological effects of genetic testing has occurred in the absence of empirical data on diseases for which predictive testing has only recently emerged. This article will review selected literature on genetic testing and its implications for the individual and the family. The responses of families and individuals to the diagnosis of a genetic disease will be reviewed, and Huntington disease will be used as the paradigm for examining issues related to genetic testing for adult-onset cancers. Literature addressing the response to genetic susceptibility for adult-onset cancers and the implications of testing children also will be explored. Finally, identification of emerging issues relevant to genetic screening will provide a framework for identifying needed nursing research in genetic testing for adult-onset cancer risk.

10089735|t|[Growing genes cause neurological diseases].
10089735|a|A growing number of hereditary neurodegenerative disorders have been found to be caused by expansion of trinucleotide repeats. A smaller number of diseases such as fragile X syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, and Friedreich's ataxia, have been found to be due to expansions in non-coding DNA. In a large group of diseases, the expansion consists of CAG repeats in the coding region of the gene, producing an expanded polyglutamine sequence in the protein. Nine diseases have so far been identified as belonging to this group: Huntington's disease, spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), autosomal dominant "pure" spastic paraplegia (ADPSP), and five forms of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA 1,2,3,6 and 7). Except for SBMA, all of the CAG repeat disorders are characterised by autosomal dominant heredity and anticipation (i.e., earlier onset age and increasing severity in successive generations). The mutated protein causes disease via an as yet unidentified gain-of-function mechanism in specific subsets of neurones. Today, DNA analysis permits the diagnosis of a trinucleotide disease in individual cases.

8995134|t|Applications of molecular epidemiology to head and neck cancer.
8995134|a|Cancer may be viewed as a genetic disease characterized by the failure of cellular mechanisms to maintain genomic integrity. Molecular progression models defining genetic damage are being developed for a number of solid tumors including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Genetic alteration of certain classes of genes, the tumor suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes, seem to be common events in such models. Host modulation of environmental carcinogens, however, also may be an important disease determinant. Interindividual differences in susceptibility to the genotoxic effects of environmental carcinogens may be genetically determined. With technologic advances in molecular genetics, it is now possible to identify specific genetic alterations that occur in different stages of neoplasia. Correlation of these genetic alterations with susceptibility models for solid tumors has important implications for the field of molecular epidemiology.

9295869|t|[Value and applications of pharmacogenetics in oncology and hematology].
9295869|a|Pharmacogenetics could be defined as the study of genetically controlled variations in drug response. Introduction of pharmacogenetics in hematology and oncology has been done recently. With recombinant DNA technology, like restriction analysis of genomic DNA, enzymatic amplification of DNA by the polymerase chain reaction and expression of cDNAs in cell cultures, this research area has been developed during the last 10 years. In hematology and oncology, we can integrate pharmacogenetics in 3 areas. First, the concept of genetic risk of cancer and the study of drug or carcinogen metabolizing enzymes that could modulate this risk, regarding the activity of some specific enzymes; second, the use of pharmacogenetics, related to the toxicity or efficacy of anticancer drugs, allowing the identification of key enzymes involved in the biotransformation of the drug and the study of molecular aspects involved in the regulation of the activity of the enzymes; third, the implication of the study of enzymatic activities in tumoral tissues as compared to non-tumoral tissues. The following differences between the 2 tissues can be subsequently used to increase the specificity of the anticancer drugs.

8952444|t|Control of hereditary diseases. Report of a WHO Scientific Group.
8952444|a|Possibilities for treating--or, ideally, avoiding--hereditary diseases have increased enormously with the rapid and radical developments in the field of molecular biology. This report of a WHO Scientific Group deals first with the human genome and the genetic basis of disease, then continues with a review of the epidemiology of genetic disorders and the role of genetic predisposition in various common conditions, including coronary heart disease, cancer, asthma, diabetes and mental disorders. In discussing prevention, the report considers both genetic family studies and population screening. It is pointed out that the cost-benefit ratio of providing genetic services is extremely favourable, and prevention is often far cheaper than treatment. An entire section of the report is devoted to genetic counseling, which is particularly important because of the psychological impact of knowledge of genetic risk and the difficult decisions that often face individuals identified as being at risk. Obstetric aspects of prenatal diagnosis are considered; techniques discussed include ultrasound scanning, chorionic villus and fetal blood sampling, and amniocentesis. Organization of genetic services is reviewed, and the ethical, social and legal aspects of genetic technology in medicine are examined. The report concludes with a summary of the Scientific Group's recommendations.

10785900|t|Issues related to the use of genetic material and information.
10785900|a|PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To review issues regarding the use of genetic materials and information. DATA SOURCES: Professional literature, regional and federal legislation. DATA SYNTHESIS: An analysis is provided of the relationship among advances in genetic technology, use of genetic material and information, and the development of laws that protect the interests of donors, researchers, and insurers. Rapid technological achievements have generated complex questions that are difficult to answer. The Human Genome Project began and the scientific discoveries were put to use before adequate professional and public debate on the ethical, legal, social, and clinical issues. The term "proper use" of genetic material and information is not defined consistently. An incomplete patchwork of protective state and federal legislation exists. CONCLUSIONS: Many complicated issues surround the use and potential misuse of genetic material and information. Rapidly advancing technology in genetics makes it difficult for regulations that protect individuals and families to keep pace. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Oncology nurses need to recognize their role as change agents, understand genetic technology, and advocate for patients by participating in the debate on the proper use and prevention of misuse of genetic material and information.

9365994|t|At issue: genes, experience, and chance in schizophrenia--positioning for the 21st century.
9365994|a|Genetic factors make important contributions to the etiologies of schizophrenia. The mode of familial inheritance remains unknown, but it is highly likely that multiple genes and idiosyncratic environmental factors are involved. Rapidly evolving genetic technologies have been applied in the genetic analysis of schizophrenia, and several genomic regions have been posited as harboring susceptibility genes. Currently, the strongest evidence implicates chromosomes 6 and 8, but these linkages are not yet confirmed. In this article we discuss genetic risk factors, gene-environment interaction, the feasibility of genetic testing, psychiatric genetic counseling, and the dangers of genetic discrimination as they apply to schizophrenia. We also address and correct specific misconceptions about the genetics of schizophrenia held by many in the scientific community and in the media, and discuss a blueprint for future genetic research and informed dissemination of findings to the public and to lawmakers.

10457506|a|This review was conducted to characterize the nature of contemporary occupational epidemiologic research involving genetic markers, consider how genetic information is unique with regard to its social applications, and examine some of the ethical dilemmas that may arise over the course of studies. We have reviewed the literature and the lessons from our experience in conducting occupational epidemiologic research involving genetic markers. This review describes how occupational epidemiologic studies differ from other epidemiologic studies on issues of participation, confidentiality, and the history of including genetic markers. Of primary concern in occupational studies are genes that have multiple alleles and are sometimes referred to as "metabolic polymorphisms." They generally do not confer risk on their own but rather only in combination with a specific exposure. There is a need for a clear policy and guidelines for the conduct of occupational epidemiologic studies using genetic material. This policy should address all of the steps in study design, implementation, interpretation, and communication of results.

7765749|t|Diagnosis and the new genetics.
7765749|a|The rapid pace of gene discovery has led to new opportunities for clinical diagnosis using molecular genetic technologies. Recent achievements include the culmination of the 10-year search for the Huntington's disease gene, the identification of predisposing genes for certain familial colon cancers, and the characterization of potential genetic risk indicators for Alzheimer's disease, hypertension, and coronary heart disease. These advances, coupled with the previous discoveries of important disease genes (e.g. those for cystic fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and fragile X syndrome) have quickly expanded the capacity of genetic analysis, allowing the design of enhanced and novel approaches for diagnostic testing. The transfer of molecular technology to the area of clinical genetic analysis, although associated with many potential benefits, has raised some concern regarding the possible misuse of genetic tests and information, particularly with regard to presymptomatic diagnosis of disease and population screening.

10766015|t|Genetics of kidney disease.
10766015|a|Perhaps nothing in the fields of medicine and nephrology is moving more rapidly than genetics. From this movement are opportunities for discovery, new therapy, and better counseling for patients. At a level of basic science, renal medicine has been a consistent contributor to this emerging discipline, but our current approach to training in the methods and uses of human genetics probably will not keep up with the technology, nor the needs of the modern bedside practitioner. The facile use of genetics in the next century will require the construction and exploration of new disease models, rededication to human informatics, and teaching the language of molecular and population genomics.

10343889|t|Coronary heart disease. At the interface of molecular genetics and preventive medicine.
10343889|a|BACKGROUND: Susceptibility to common chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease (CHD) appears to be influenced by "context-dependent effects," which include interactions among genes (genetic epistasis) and among genes and environmental factors (gene-environment interactions). METHODS: A synthesis of current knowledge and research findings demonstrates the importance of integrating genetic research on cardiovascular disease with preventive medicine and public health initiatives. RESULTS: A variety of candidate genes have been implicated in risk for CHD, but only limited examples of context-dependent effects have been described. Interactions between genetic and environmental factors appear to influence lipid metabolism, plasma homocysteine levels, and pharmacologic response to many commonly prescribed medications. Quantification of genetic effects associated with increased disease risk that are modifiable by interventions such as diet, exercise, and smoking cessation is an important interface between molecular genetics and preventive medicine. CONCLUSIONS: As a primary focus of preventive medicine expands to encompass early detection and treatment of asymptomatic individuals at risk for disease, the ability to quantify the influence of context-dependent effects on disease risk will be critical for determining drug safety and effectiveness in diverse patient populations and for implementing effective prevention and treatment programs.

9719668|t|Ethical, legal, and social issues of the Human Genome Project: what to do with what we know.
9719668|a|Since fiscal year 1991, the U.S. Human Genome Project has spent $170.6 million in federal funds to help isolate genes associated with Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2, myotonic dystrophy, and fragile X syndrome and to localize genes that predispose people to breast cancer, colon cancer, hypertension, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. Now comes the hard part. Biology's 21st century megaproject starts to look relatively manageable compared to another challenge facing the enterprise: sorting out ethical, legal, and social issues associated with using this information. "The Human Genome Project," wrote Senior Editor Barbara Jasny in the October 1 Science editorial, stretches "the limits of the technology and the limits of our ability to ethically and rationally apply genetic information to our lives."

10378978|t|Genetically and medically susceptible workers.
10378978|a|The likelihood of an individual becoming ill from a hazardous material or condition is strongly influenced by both their genetic makeup and their underlying state of health. Although the past decade has seen great advances in understanding human variation in health and genetic polymorphisms and in the diagnosis and treatment of disease, much less progress has been made in effectively using this information to protect worker health. Scientific evidence for increased susceptibility often is weak and rarely satisfies legal thresholds for sufficient risk to warrant exclusion from a particular job. When public safety is a major concern, many legally mandated exclusions are not well justified. Medical opinions about fitness to work should be based upon a systematic and credible analysis of the condition, its relationship to ability and risk for a particular job, and knowledge of possible accommodations. Conclusions should reflect the limitations of scientific knowledge and guidance from antidiscrimination legislation.

10889865|t|Hereditary breast cancer. Psychosocial issues and family physicians' role.
10889865|a|OBJECTIVES: To outline the psychosocial issues in hereditary breast cancer (HBC) assessment and discuss the role of family physicians. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: A literature search using MEDLINE, CINAHL, CancerLit, and HealthStar databases was conducted from January 1990 to April 1998, using the key words breast cancer or neoplasm and familial or hereditary, genetic testing or screening, primary care or family physician or counseling, genetic counseling, psychosocial or psychological. We found only a few studies focusing on a small number of well-studied "research families." MAIN FINDINGS: Women with a family history of breast cancer were likely to be highly interested in genetic testing for cancer risk. The benefit of testing for those with negative results is reassurance. Those found to be carriers of genetic mutations might benefit from increased surveillance and prophylactic therapy. Risks of testing include anxiety, depression, guilt, altered self-image, and insurance and employment discrimination. A family physician's role is to assess risk, to provide information and support so women can make informed choices about referral to familial cancer clinics, to offer cancer surveillance, and to provide support once genetic test results are available. CONCLUSION: Genetic testing is rapidly moving from research to clinical applications. Family physicians play an integral role in educating and managing women at risk for HBC. Physicians must prepare themselves with knowledge and counseling skills to meet the challenges of this new technology.

10805957|t|Genetic counseling and clinical cancer genetics services.
10805957|a|Cancer genetic services, typically provided by clinicians with expertise in both oncology and genetics, include cancer risk assessment and education, facilitation of genetic testing, pre-and post-test counseling, provision of personally tailored cancer risk management options and recommendations, and psychosocial counseling and support services. All oncology providers should obtain basic information on the family cancer history of their patients to determine the likelihood of hereditary cancer risk as well as possible indications for providing brief or comprehensive cancer genetic counseling. Those who choose to provide these services themselves must be familiar with the complex issues of genetic counseling and testing, and be aware of the time and expertise required to adequately deliver these services. Genetic nurses and genetic counselors with master's degrees function as valuable members of a comprehensive cancer genetic service; they are trained to independently collect and confirm medical and family history information, perform risk assessments, offer patient education regarding cancer and genetics, and provide supportive counseling services for patients and families. It is hoped that specific risk interventions will significantly reduce morbidity and mortality from familial forms of cancer. This review outlines the process of cancer genetic counseling and defines the roles of the cancer genetic counselor and the function of the cancer genetics specialty clinic. The possible medical and legal implications for failing to obtain adequate family history information are reviewed, and the issues of genetic discrimination are discussed.

7929798|t|The role of genetic factors in multiple sclerosis susceptibility.
7929798|a|There has been increasing evidence that genetic factors have a role in determining susceptibility to MS. Re-examination of results from prevalence and migration surveys reveals that there remains considerable ambiguity in interpretation. Some patterns previously thought to decisively support environmental determination may still be explained, at least in part, on a genetic basis. It seems inescapable that MS is probably due to an interaction of genetic and environmental factors. It remains undetermined whether or not genes exist which are truly necessary for the development of the disease. Existing data are consistent with the notion that the study of MS susceptibility will parallel the findings in experimental models of spontaneous autoimmunity and that at very least, two genes and almost certainly several genes will be found to influence susceptibility and interact in as yet unknown ways. One of these loci appears to be the Class II MHC, although its role may be minor at the germ line level. Roles for the T-cell receptor alpha and beta loci appear to be minor and may even be non-existent in contributing to heritable susceptibility. We predict that additional loci will be identified which influence both susceptibility and outcome and will be more important. Furthermore, it is clear that the understanding of the contribution of individual susceptibility loci will continue to be difficult because of the constraints of human pedigree data. It is likely that further resolution of the questions posed above related to genetic susceptibility in MS will require multicenter collaboration.

8936580|t|Gene-environment interaction: definitions and study designs.
8936580|a|Study of gene-environment interaction is important for improving accuracy and precision in the assessment of both genetic and environmental influences. This overview presents a simple definition of gene-environment interaction and suggests study designs for detecting it. Gene-environment interaction is defined as "a different effect of an environmental exposure on disease risk in persons with different genotypes," or, alternatively, "a different effect of a genotype on disease risk in persons with different environmental exposures." Under this strictly statistical definition, the presence or absence of interaction depends upon the scale of measurement (additive or multiplicative). The decision of which scale is appropriate will be governed by many factors, including the main objective of an investigation (discovery of etiology, public health prediction, etc.) and the hypothesized pathophysiologic model. Five biologically plausible models are described for the relations between genotypes and environmental exposures, in terms of their effects on disease risk. Each of these models leads to a different set of predictions about disease risk in individuals classified by presence or absence of a high-risk genotype and environmental exposure. Classification according to the exposure is relatively easy, using conventional epidemiologic methods. Classification according to the high-risk genotype is more difficult, but several alternative strategies are suggested.

10203748|t|Radiation, DNA damage and cancer.
10203748|a|The characterization of the rare, radiation-sensitive and cancer-prone syndromes, ataxia telangiectasia and Nijmegen breakage syndrome, has demonstrated that genetic predisposition increases the risk of developing cancer after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR). Molecular analyses of these disorders provide valuable insights into the normal function of these two gene products in the cellular response to IR-induced DNA damage. Their contribution to a cellular radiosensitive phenotype and their role in sporadic cancers can now be fully assessed. For example, the gene ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) has recently been shown to be a tumour suppressor gene in T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia, and there is increasing evidence that individuals with one mutated ATM or Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS1) allele have an increased predisposition to cancer.

10854459|t|Risk communication in genetic testing for cancer susceptibility.
10854459|a|Risk communication is an integral part of genetic counseling and testing for cancer susceptibility. This paper reviews the emerging literature on this topic. Three relevant aspects of risk communication are addressed: communication of individual risk, communication of the risks inherent in genetic testing, and family communications related to risk. These studies suggest that (a) most individuals with some family history of cancer, including those at low to moderate risk, overestimate their personal cancer risk; (b) awareness of the risks of genetic testing is limited; (c) decision making about genetic testing is influenced strongly by exaggerated perceptions of personal cancer risk and less so by perceptions of the risks of genetic testing; (d) perceptions of personal risk of cancer are resistant to standard education and counseling approaches; (e) psychologic distress and coping processes influence the processing of risk information and subsequent decision making in genetic testing; and (f) family influences play an important role in risk awareness, genetic testing decisions, and outcomes. To study these issues further, new theoretical models and measures of risk perceptions need to be developed. Both observational and experimental methods should be used to examine both the content and process of risk communication in cancer genetic counseling and testing. Emotional, familial, and sociocultural influences on the risk communication process require special attention.

9349686|t|Molecular epidemiology: carcinogen-DNA adducts and genetic susceptibility.
9349686|a|Molecular epidemiological studies assess individual chemical exposures and genetic susceptibility in order to identify cancer risk. Such studies incorporate the development, application, and validation of biomarkers of cancer risk in order to enhance cancer risk assessments, focus cancer prevention strategies, and elucidate mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Current studies of molecular epidemiology are based upon an understanding of the complex, multistage process of carcinogenesis and interindividual variations in response to carcinogenic exposures. Quantitative methods to measure human exposures to carcinogens continue to improve and have been successfully applied to a number of epidemiological studies. Genetic predispositions to cancer, both inherited and acquired, have been and continue to be identified. The combined approach of associating genetic polymorphisms with carcinogen-DNA adduct measurements, in order to assess cancer risk, is showing considerable promise. It is hoped that, in the future, molecular epidemiologists will be able to develop a risk profile for an individual that includes assessment of multiple biomarkers. The field has the near-term potential to have a significant impact on regulatory quantitative risk assessments, which may aid in the determination of allowable exposures. Molecular epidemiological data may also aid in the identification of individuals who will most benefit by cancer prevention strategies.
