      "PMID:  17853970\n",
      "Abs: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an adult-onset inherited condition characterized by migraine, recurrent strokes, and subcortical dementia. Other manifestations as psychiatric disturbances, seizures, hypoacusia or learning disorders have been reported. CADASIL may be suspected based on clinical syndrome, a positive family history, and a typical cranial magnetic resonance image with T2/FLAIR hyperintense signals in the temporopolar white matter or the external capsule. Bilateral white matter abnormalities are invariably seen and often small subcortical infarcts are also present. Accumulation of the granular osmiophilic material on skin biopsy may help in diagnosis. Mutations in the NOTCH3 gene localized in chromosome 19 are involved in its pathogenesis. Only 11 families from Spain have been reported. Here we describe two members of a family with clinical symptoms and neuroimaging of CADASIL. The skin biopsy was negative. In both patients 346C>T mutation in exon 3 of NOTCH3 gene was found. There is the first Spanish family reported with CADASIL, caused by the 346C > T mutation in NOTCH3 gene which was frequently described in the European series.\n",

      "PMID:  16325861\n",
      "Abs: Mutations in the brain-specific P/Q type Ca2+ channel alpha1 subunit gene, CACNA1A, have been identified in three clinically distinct disorders, spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6), episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2), and familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1). SCA6 is associated with small expansions of a CAG repeat at the 3' end of the gene, while point mutations are mostly responsible for its two allelic disorders, FHMI and EA2. From the electrophysiological point of view, while FHMI mutations lead to a gain of function [Tottene A, Fellin T, Pagnutti S, Luvisetto S, Striessnig J, Fletcher C, et al. Familial hemiplegic migraine mutations increase Ca2+ influx through single human CaV2.1 channels and decrease maximal CaV2.1 current density in neurons. Proc Natl Acad Sci 99 (20) (2002) 13284-13289.], EA2 mutations usually generate a loss of channel function [Guida S, Trettel F, Pagnutti S, Mantuano E, Tottene A, Veneziano L, et al. Complete loss of P/Q calcium channel activity caused by a CACNA1A missense mutation carried by patients with episodic ataxia type 2. Am J Hum Genet 68 (3) (2001) 759-764, Wappl E, Koschak A, Poteser M, Sinnegger MJ, Walter D, Eberhart A, et al. Functional consequences of P/Q-type Ca2+ channel Cav2.1 missense mutations associated with episodic ataxia type 2 and progressive ataxia. J Biol Chem 277 (9) (2002) 6960-6966.]. In the present study, we describe a child affected by permanent non-fluctuating limb and trunk ataxia with a quite early age of onset. Interestingly, the size of the CACNA1A triplet repeat region in the patient is within the normal range while he carries a novel de novo missense mutation in this gene, p.R1664Q. Although functional data are not available, based on the literature data indicating that severe reductions in P/Q-type channel activity favour episodic and/or progressive ataxic symptoms [Wappl E, Koschak A, Poteser M, Sinnegger MJ, Walter D, Eberhart A, et al. Functional consequences of P/Q-type Ca2+ channel Cav2.1 missense mutations associated with episodic ataxia type 2 and progressive ataxia. J Biol Chem 2002;277(9):6960-6966.], we hypothesize that the functional consequence of the mutation here identified is a partial loss of the Ca channel function. In conclusion, the clinical and molecular findings reported here suggest the opportunity to screen for point mutation in this gene, even patients with a clinical phenotype for some aspects slightly different from the typical picture more commonly associated to SCA6, EA2 or FHM1 diseases.\n",

      "Abs: Episodic ataxia type 1 is a paroxysmal neurological disorder characterized by short-lived attacks of recurrent midline cerebellar dysfunction and continuous motor activity. Mutations in KCN1A, the gene encoding Kv1.1, a voltage-gated neuronal potassium channel, are associated with the disorder. Although rare, the syndrome highlights the fundamental features of genetic ion-channel diseases and serves as a useful model for understanding more common paroxysmal disorders, such as epilepsy and migraine. This review examines our current understanding of episodic ataxia type 1, focusing on its clinical and genetic features, pathophysiology, and treatment.\n",

      "Abs: THE ROLE OF IONIC CHANNEL DYSFUNCTION: During various neurological diseases has been evoked for many years on electro-physiological data. Molecular biology has led to great progress in neurology, and can be considered \"functional\" since it is surpasses the classical anatomo-clinical methods. IONIC CHANNEL DYSFUNCTION: Can be determined genetically, resulting from the mutation of a gene code of a channel sub-unit. CHANNELOPATHIES ARE RESPONSIBLE: For muscular diseases (myotonia, familial periodic paralysis, malignant hyperthermia and congenital myasthenia), but also for central nervous system disorders such as familial hemiplegic migraine, hereditary paroxystic ataxia and certain forms of Mendel's law hereditary epilepsy. ACQUIRED IONIC CHANNEL DYSFUNCTION: Resulting from auto-immune aggression is implied in diseases such as Lambert-Eaton's myasthenic syndrome and Isaac's neuromyotonia syndrome. It probably plays a part in the clinical, and particularly the sensitive expression (paresthesia and pain) of some peripheral neuropathies and certain central nervous system affections, such as multiple sclerosis.\n",

      "PMID:  9548007\n",
      "Abs: CADASIL is an inherited small-artery disease of the brain due to mutations of the Notch3 gene on chromosome 19. It is characterized by strokes, migraine with aura, and severe mood disturbances during mid adulthood and leads progressively to subcortical dementia. The precise onset of the cognitive decline in CADASIL remains unknown. We report here the cognitive evaluation of 8 non-demented symptomatic patients with CADASIL from 35 to 66 years of age. Altered performances were found in all subjects with the Wisconsin Card-Sorting Test (WCST), in 5/8 with the Trail-Making Test, and in 3/8 with copying of Rey's figure. Altered performances with codes and similarities of the WAIS-R, the Wechsler Memory Scale, Raven's Progressive Matrices, and the category and letter fluency task were observed less frequently (n < or = 2). The score obtained with the WCST was not significantly correlated with the severity of the white-matter or basal ganglia signal abnormalities at MRI examination. Our data show that: (1) symptomatic CADASIL patients, although non-demented, can present with a subtle cognitive impairment; (2) tasks involving the frontal lobes are found most frequently altered, and (3) this subtle cognitive deficit can develop in the absence of major vascular events and does not appear to be correlated with the severity of brain lesions as seen at MRI examination.\n",

      "PMID:  27786243\n",
      "Abs: The primary headache disorders, which include migraine, cluster headache and tension-type headache, are among the most common diseases and leading causes of disability worldwide. The available treatment options for primary headache disorders have unsatisfactory rates of efficacy, tolerability and patient adherence. In this Review, we discuss promising new approaches for the prevention of primary headache disorders, such as monoclonal antibodies targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) or its receptor, and small-molecule CGRP receptor antagonists. Neuromodulation approaches employing noninvasive or implantable devices also show promise for treating primary headache disorders. Noninvasive treatments, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation, are delivered by devices that patients can self-administer. Implantable devices targeting the occipital nerves, sphenopalatine ganglion or high cervical spinal cord are placed using percutaneous and/or surgical procedures, and are powered either wirelessly or by surgically implanted batteries. These new and emerging treatments have the potential to address unmet patient needs and reduce headache-associated disability.\n",

This autosomal-dominant condition is caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene and is characterized by degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells. At present, no evidence-based treatment for CADASIL is available and only relief of symptoms can be offered to patients. This review focuses on an update of CADASIL management, based on the recent clinical and basic evidence, and discusses possible new treatment targets for CADASIL.\n",

      "PMID:  18494989\n",
      "Abs: Upper cervical pain is frequent in different primary headaches and not sufficient evidence for cervicogenic headache (CH). Biological markers should help to differentiate CH from other headache disorders. In most cases, imaging techniques of the cervical spine are not helpful for the diagnosis of CH. Symptoms and signs of neck involvement, such as a mechanical precipitation of attacks, a restriction in range of motion of the cervical spine, and the existence of ipsilateral neck, shoulder, or arm pain, seem to be reasonably valid for the diagnosis of CH, but its reliability and validity should be confirmed in larger studies. Positive diagnostic blockades of cervical structures or its nerve supply are not specific for CH. Neurophysiological investigations give some insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms of CH but are not diagnostic. In CH, calcitonin gene-related peptide levels do not differ between the symptomatic and the asymptomatic side, between the jugular and the cubital blood, and between days with and without headache. There is no evidence for an activation of the trigeminovascular system in CH. It can be concluded that CH is not just a migraine variant triggered by neck dysfunction but a functional entity.\n",

      "Abs: We report the case of a 19-year-old Chinese female harboring the m.3291T>C mutation in the MT-TL1 gene encoding the mitochondrial transfer RNA for leucine. She presented with a complex phenotype characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, frequent myoclonus seizures, recurrent stroke-like episodes, migraine-like headaches with nausea and vomiting, and elevated resting lactate blood level. It is known that the myoclonus epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF) is characterized by cerebellar ataxia and myoclonus epilepsy, while that the mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is characterized by recurrent stroke-like episodes, migraine-like headaches, and elevated resting lactate blood level. So the patient's clinical manifestations suggest the presence of a MERRF/MELAS overlap syndrome. Muscle biopsy of the patient showed the presence of numerous scattered ragged-red fibers, some cytochrome c oxidase-deficient fibers, and several strongly succinate dehygrogenase-reactive vessels, suggestive of a mitochondrial disorder. Direct sequencing of the complete mitochondrial genome of the proband revealed no mutations other than the T-to-C transition at nucleotide position 3291. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the proband and her family revealed maternal inheritance of the mutation in a heteroplasmic manner. The analysis of aerobic respiration and glycolysis demonstrated that the fibroblasts from the patient had mitochondrial dysfunction. Our results suggest that the m.3291T>C is pathogenic. This study is the first to describe the m.3291T>C mutation in association with the MERRF/MELAS overlap syndrome.\n",

      "PMID:  20420834\n",
      "Abs: Voltage-gated sodium channelopathies underlie many excitability disorders. Genes SCN1A, SCN2A and SCN9A, which encode pore-forming alpha-subunits Na(V)1.1, Na(V)1.2 and Na(V)1.7, are clustered on human chromosome 2, and mutations in these genes have been shown to underlie epilepsy, migraine, and somatic pain disorders. SCN3A, the gene which encodes Na(V)1.3, is part of this cluster, but until recently was not associated with any mutation. A charge-neutralizing mutation, K345Q, in the Na(V)1.3 DI/S5-6 linker has recently been identified in a patient with cryptogenic partial epilepsy. Pathogenicity of the Na(V)1.3/K354Q mutation has been inferred from the conservation of this residue in all sodium channels and its absence from control alleles, but functional analysis has been limited to the corresponding substitution in the cardiac muscle sodium channel Na(V)1.5. Since identical mutations may produce different effects within different sodium channel isoforms, we assessed the K354Q mutation within its native Na(V)1.3 channel and studied the effect of the mutant Na(V)1.3/K354Q channels on hippocampal neuron excitability. We show here that the K354Q mutation enhances the persistent and ramp currents of Na(V)1.3, reduces current threshold and produces spontaneous firing and paroxysmal depolarizing shift-like complexes in hippocampal neurons. Our data provide a pathophysiological basis for the pathogenicity of the first epilepsy-linked mutation within Na(V)1.3 channels and hippocampal neurons.CI - (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

      "PMID:  29018204\n",
      "Abs: Low GABA transmission has been reported in suicide, and GABRA6 rs3219151 T allele has been associated with greater physiological and endocrine stress response in previous studies. Although environmental stress also plays a role in suicide, the possible role of this allele has not been investigated in this respect. In our present study effect of rs3219151 of GABRA6 gene in interaction with recent negative life events on lifetime and current depression, current anxiety, as well as lifetime suicide were investigated using regression models in a white European general sample of 2283 subjects. Post hoc measures for phenotypes related to suicide risk were also tested for association with rs3219151 in interaction with environmental stress. No main effect of the GABRA6 rs3219151 was detected, but in those exposed to recent negative life events GABRA6 T allele increased current anxiety and depression as well as specific elements of suicide risk including suicidal and death-related thoughts, hopelessness, restlessness and agitation, insomnia and impulsiveness as measured by the STOP task. Our data indicate that stress-associated suicide risk is elevated in carriers of the GABRA6 rs3219151 T allele with several independent markers and predictors of suicidal behaviours converging to this increased risk.\n",

For SCA6, due to CAGn expansions, a toxic gain of function might, instead, be envisaged homologous to that of glutamine repeat disorders. A comparison between SCA6 and EA2 phenotypes performed on available literature data, shows that the clinical features of the two disorders are widely overlapping and that the differences could be accounted for with the older age of patients in the SCA6 group. A similar phenotype in the two disorders could imply the same pathogenic process.

      "PMID:  24609974\n",
      "Abs: Mutations in PRRT2 have recently been identified as the major cause of autosomal dominant benign familial infantile epilepsy (BFIE), infantile convulsions with choreoathetosis syndrome (ICCA), and paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD). Other paroxysmal disorders like febrile seizures, migraine, paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia, and paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia have also been shown to be associated with this gene. We re-evaluated PRRT2 mutations and genetic-clinical correlations in additional cases with PKD/ICCA and other paroxysmal disorders. Two novel mutations in PRRT2 were revealed in PKD/ICCA cases, while no mutations were detected in other diseases, which suggests BFIE and PKD are still core phenotypes of PRRT2-related spectrum disorders.\n",

      "Title: Pathophysiology of medication overuse headache--an update\n",
      "PMID:  24117004\n",
      "Abs: The pathogenesis of medication overuse headache is unclear. Clinical and preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated increased excitability of neurons in the cerebral cortex and trigeminal system after medication overuse. Cortical hyperexcitability may facilitate the development of cortical spreading depression, while increased excitability of trigeminal neurons may facilitate the process of peripheral and central sensitization. These changes may be secondary to the derangement of central, probably serotonin (5-HT)-, and perhaps endocannabinoid-dependent or other, modulating systems. Increased expression of excitatory cortical 5-HT2A receptors may increase the susceptibility to developing cortical spreading depression, an analog of migraine aura. A reduction of diffuse noxious inhibitory controls may facilitate the process of central sensitization, activate the nociceptive facilitating system, or promote similar molecular mechanisms to those involved in kindling. Low 5-HT levels also increase the expression and release of calcitonin gene-related peptide from the trigeminal ganglion and sensitize trigeminal nociceptors. Thus, derangement of central modulation of the trigeminal system as a result of chronic medication use may increase sensitivity to pain perception and foster or reinforce medication overuse headache.CI - © 2013 American Headache Society.\n",

      "PMID:  31643000\n",
      "Abs: We provide a comprehensive review of the available evidence on the pathophysiological implications of genetic variants in the human trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR) superfamily. Genes coding for trace amine-associated receptors (taars) represent a multigene family of G-protein-coupled receptors, clustered to a small genomic region of 108 kb located in chromosome 6q23, which has been consistently identified by linkage analyses as a susceptibility locus for schizophrenia and affective disorders. Most TAARs are expressed in brain areas involved in emotions, reward and cognition. TAARs are activated by endogenous trace amines and thyronamines, and evidence for a modulatory action on other monaminergic systems has been reported. Therefore, linkage analyses were followed by fine mapping association studies in schizophrenia and affective disorders. However, none of these reports has received sufficient universal replication, so their status remains uncertain. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in taars have emerged as susceptibility loci from genome-wide association studies investigating migraine and brain development, but none of the detected variants reached the threshold for genome-wide significance. In the last decade, technological advances enabled single-gene or whole-exome sequencing, thus allowing the detection of rare genetic variants, which may have a greater impact on the risk of complex disorders. Using these approaches, several taars (especially taar1) variants have been detected in patients with mental and metabolic disorders, and in some cases, defective receptor function has been demonstrated in vitro. Finally, with the use of transcriptomic and peptidomic techniques, dysregulations of TAARs (especially TAAR6) have been identified in brain disorders characterized by cognitive impairment.\n",

It is generally thought that loss-of-function mutations are associated with EA2, gain-of-function missense mutations with FHM1, and abnormal CAG expansions with SCA6. But, overlapping features, atypical symptoms and co-occurrence of distinct phenotypes within the same family were reported.

      "Abs: The neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel Na(v)1.1 encoded by the SCN1A gene plays an important role in the generation and propagation of action potentials in the central nervous system. Altered function of this channel due to mutations in SCN1A leads to hypersynchronous neuronal discharges resulting in seizures or migrainous attaques. A large number of distinct sequence variants in SCN1A are associated with diverse epilepsy and migraine syndromes. We developed an online and freely available database containing all reported sequence variants in SCN1A (http://www.molgen.ua.ac.be/SCN1AMutations/). We verified 623 distinct sequence variants, listed them using standard nomenclature for description and classified them according to their putative pathogenic nature. We provided links to relevant publications and information on the associated phenotype. The database can be queried using cDNA or protein position, phenotype, variant type or publication. By listing all SCN1A variants in a comprehensive manner, this database will facilitate interpretation of newly identified sequence variants and provide better insight into the genotype-phenotype relations of the growing number of SCN1A mutations.\n",

      "PMID:  26472135\n",
      "Abs: The pain-signaling molecules, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), are implicated in the pathophysiology of post-traumatic headache (PTH) as they are for migraine. This study assessed the changes of inducible NOS (iNOS) and its cellular source in the trigeminal pain circuit, as well as the relationship between iNOS and CGRP after controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury in mice. The effects of a CGRP antagonist (MK8825) and sumatriptan on iNOS messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein were compared to vehicle at 2 weeks postinjury. Changes in CGRP levels in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) in iNOS knockouts with CCI were compared to wild-type (WT) mice at 3 days and 2 weeks post injury. Trigeminal allodynia and photosensitivity were measured. MK8825 and sumatriptan increased allodynic thresholds in CCI groups compared to vehicle (p < 0.01), whereas iNOS knockouts were not different from WT. Photosensitivity was attenuated in MK8825 mice and iNOS knockouts compared to WT (p < 0.05). MK8825 and sumatriptan reduced levels of iNOS mRNA and iNOS immunoreactivity in the TNC and ganglia (p < 0.01). Differences in iNOS cellular localization were found between the trigeminal ganglia and TNC. Although the knockout of iNOS attenuated CGRP at 3 days (p < 0.05), it did not reduce CGRP at 2 weeks. CGRP immunoreactivity was found in the meningeal layers post-CCI, while negligible in controls. Findings support the importance of interactions between CGRP and iNOS in mediating allodynia, as well as the individual roles in photosensitivity. Mitigating prolonged increases in CGRP may be a promising intervention for treating acute PTH.\n",

      "PMID:  16979414\n",
      "Abs: Topiramate (TPM) is a novel neurotherapeutic agent approved for the treatment of epilepsy and for migraine prophylaxis. It has been observed that in obese-associated, type 2 diabetic rodent models, TPM treatment reduced the body weight gain, improved insulin sensitivity, and enhanced glucose-regulated insulin release. A long-term treatment with TPM thus ameliorated obesity and diabetic syndromes in female Zucker diabetic fatty rats and db/db mice. The molecular mechanisms of TPM antiobesity and antidiabetic effects remain unknown. We have applied DNA microarray technology to explore genes that might be involved in the mechanisms by which TPM improves insulin sensitivity and blood glucose handling, as well as body weight control. In female Zucker diabetic fatty rats, 7-day TPM treatment significantly reduced the plasma levels of glucose and triglyceride in a dose-dependent manner. The DNA microarray data revealed that TPM treatment altered messenger RNA profiles in liver, hypothalamus, white adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle. The most marked effect of TPM on gene expression occurred in liver with those genes related with metabolic enzymes and signaling regulatory proteins involved in energy metabolism. TPM treatment decreased messenger RNA amounts for sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, stearoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) desaturase-1, choline kinase, and fatty acid CoA ligase, long chain 4. TPM also up-regulated 3 cholesterol synthesis genes. In addition, the short-term effect of TPM on gene expression was examined at 16 hours after a single administration. TPM markedly reduced hepatic expression of genes related with fatty acid synthesis, eg, stearoyl-CoA desaturase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase. TPM also changed genes related with fatty acid beta-oxidation, increased 3-2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase and mitochondrial acyl-CoA thioesterase, and decreased fatty acid CoA ligase (long chain 2 and long chain 5). These gene expression changes were independent of food intake as shown by pair feeding. Our results suggest that TPM regulates hepatic expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, which could be part of the mechanisms by which TPM reduces plasma triglyceride levels in obese diabetic rodents.\n",

      "Abs: Vestibular diagnostics and therapy is the mirror of technological, scientific and socio-economics trends as are other fields of clinical medicine. These trends have led to a substantial diversification of the field of neurotology. The improvements in diagnostics have been characterized by the introduction of new receptor testing tools (e. g., VEMPs), progress in imaging (e. g., the endolymphatic hydrops) and in the description of central-vestibular neuroplasticity. The etiopathology of vestibular disorders has been updated by geneticists (e. g., the description of the COCH gene mutations), the detection of structural abnormalities (e. g., dehiscence syndromes) and related disorders (e. g. migraine-associated vertigo). The therapeutic options were extended by re-evaluation of techniques known a long time ago (e. g., saccus exposure), the development of new approaches (e. g., dehiscence repair) and the introduction of new drug therapy concepts (e. g., local drug delivery). Implantable, neuroprosthetic solutions have not yet reached experimental safety and validity and are still far away. However, externally worn neuroprosthetic solution were introduced in the rehab of vestibular disorders (e. g., VertiGuard system). These and related trends point into a medical future which is characterized by presbyvertigo as classical sign of the demographic changes ahead, by shortage of financial resources and a medico-legally over-regulated, even hostile environment for physicians in clinical medicine.CI - © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.\n",

      "Title: Disorders of membrane channels or channelopathies\n",
      "PMID:  11137655\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: To review the structure and function of membrane ion channels with special emphasis on inherited nervous system channel disorders or channelopathies. RESULTS: Channels are pores in the cell membrane. Through these pores ions flow across the membrane and depolarize or hyperpolarize the cell. Channels can be classified into 3 types: non-gated, directly gated and second messenger gated channels. Among the important directly gated channels are voltage gated (Na(+), K(+), Ca(2+), Cl(-)) and ligand gated (ACh, Glutamate, GABA, Glycine) channels. Channels are macromolecular protein complexes within the lipid membrane. They are divided into distinct protein units called subunits. Each subunit has a specific function and is encoded by a different gene. The following inherited channelopathies are described. (1) Sodium channelopathies: familial generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, paramyotonias, hypokalemic periodic paralysis; (2) potassium channelopathies: benign infantile epilepsy, episodic ataxia type 1; (3) calcium channelopathies: episodic ataxia type 2, spinocerebellar ataxia type 6, familial hemiplegic migraine, hypokalemic periodic paralysis, central core disease, malignant hyperthermia syndrome, congenital stationary night blindness; (4) chloride channelopathies: myotonia congenitas; (5) ACh receptor channelopathies: autosomal dominant frontal lobe nocturnal epilepsy, congenital myasthenic syndromes; (6) glycine receptor channelopathies: hyperekplexia. CONCLUSIONS: Studies of human inherited channelopathies have clarified the functions of many ion channels. More than one gene may regulate a function in a channel, thus different genetic mutations may manifest with the same disorder. The complex picture of the genetic and molecular structures of channels will require frequent updates.\n",

      "PMID:  20558831\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A number of single gene disorders can cause cerebral small vessel disease. Mutations in the COL4A1 gene encoding the type IV collagen alpha 1 chain, which are already associated with porencephaly and infantile hemiparesis, have been recently recognized as a further monogenic cause of small vessel disease that can present in adulthood. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of published data from 1966 to January 8, 2010 to characterize the features of small vessel disease seen with COL4A1 mutations. RESULTS: We identified a total of 52 mutation carriers. A history of stroke was reported in 9 subjects (17.3%); in 6 cases it was attributable to subcortical hemorrhage and in 3 cases it was attributable to lacunar infarction. Stroke often occurred as first presentation of the disease, with a mean age of onset of 36.1 (SD, 12.95; range, 14-49). Hemorrhages, often recurrent, have been associated with physical trauma and activity and anticoagulant therapy. Brain imaging showed frequent leukoaraiosis (63.5%), microbleeds that are usually subcortical (52.9%), lacunar infarction (13.5%), and dilated perivascular spaces (19.2%). Extensive leukoaraiosis was seen in a number of asymptomatic adult mutation carriers. Asymptomatic intracranial aneurysms were common (44.4% of 18 with angiography). Migraine (with and without aura) was reported in 10 subjects, with a mean age at onset of 31.7. Systemic features are also frequent, affecting the eye (10/21, 47.6%), kidney (15.4%), and muscle (15.4%). CONCLUSIONS: COL4A1 is a further cause of familial vasculopathy and may present with stroke, ischemic as well as hemorrhagic, in adult life and with radiological features of leukoaraiosis and microbleeds.\n",

      "PMID:  17996090\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is increasingly recognized as an inherited arterial disease leading to a step-wise decline and eventually to dementia. CADASIL is caused by mutations in NOTCH3 epidermal growth factor-like repeat that maps to chromosome 19. CADASIL cases have been identified in most countries of Western and Central Europe, the Americas, Japan, Australia, the Caribbean, South America, Tanzania, Turkey, South Africa and Southeast Asia, but not in Arabs. METHODS: We studied three families from Saudi Arabia (Family A), Kuwait (Family B) and Yemen (Family C) with 19 individuals affected by CADASIL. RESULTS: The mean age of onset was 31 +/- 6 and the clinical presentation included stroke in 68%, subcortical dementia in 17% and asymptomatic leukoariosis detected by MRI in 15%. Migraine and depression were frequently associated, 38% and 68% respectively. The mean age of death was 56 +/- 11. All NOTCH3 exons were screened for mutations, which revealed the presence of previously reported mutations c.406C>T (p.Arg110>Cys) in two families (family A&B) and c.475C>T (p.Arg133>Cys) mutation in family C. CONCLUSION: CADASIL occurs in Arabs, with clinical phenotype and genotype similar to that in other ethnic groups.\n",

      "PMID:  30877727\n",
      "Abs: Hereditary types of ischemic cerebral subcortical small vessel disease (SSVD) are rare, usually autosomal dominant, diseases, due to an abnormality in vessel wall synthesis. They may present with various combinations of migraine with aura, ischemic events (transient ischemic attacks, lacunar strokes) and progressively worsening ischemic lesion load in brain imaging. Eventually, vascular cognitive impairment (usually of the frontal-subcortical type) develops, frequently accompanied by behavioral-psychiatric symptoms and bilateral pyramidal and pseudobulbar signs leading to severe disability and premature death. In some patients, microbleeds and hemorrhagic strokes may be present. Despite their rarity, these disorders offer a statistically homogeneous population (usually without additional pathology such as Alzheimer's disease), suitable for the study of vascular cognitive impairment. The few studies on the relative frequency of these disorders indicate that the most frequent (or rather the least rare), accounting for more than half of patients, is CADASIL, due to mutations of the NOTCH3 gene, followed by COL4A1/A2-related disease, autosomal dominant forms of HTRA1-related disease and leucoencephalopathies with calcifications and cysts. Mutations of TREX1, GLA, FOXC1 and CARASIL are less frequent. Despite the genetic nature of these disorders, their phenotype, severity and rate of progression may be adversely affected by classical cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia and smoking and control of these risk factors is strongly advised for all patients.\n",

      "PMID:  29694000\n",
      "Abs: Small cerebral vessel disease is a relatively new group of angiopathies diagnosed more frequently thanks to common availability of neuroimaging. The most frequent and the most known disease which belongs to this group is CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy). Despite the name, it is a generalized small vessel disease, in which symptoms of brain damage dominate. The disease manifests as recurrent ischemic strokes, progressing dementia, migraine and mental disorders – symptoms which usually appear in 4-5 decade of life in patients without typical risk factors for vascular disease. In neuroimaging hyperintense changes and small ischemic foci disseminated in the cerebral white matter are seen. CADASIL is caused by mutations in the NOTCH 3 gene, which lead to the degeneration and loss of smooth muscle cells in small arteries. The disease is diagnosed on the basis of the result of the genetic test and microscopic examination of blood vessels in the material derived from a skin or skinmuscle biopsy. Since more and more frequently new techniques of neuroimaging reveal changes in the cerebral white matter - often asymptomatic or/ and mistakenly diagnosed as demyelinating lesions - only knowledge about CADASIL and other microangiopathies allows to avoid diagnostic errors.\n",

      "Abs: The concept of neurogenic control of the cerebral circulation began to develop only as recent as the middle of the 20(th) century, when it was elucidated that the cerebral blood vessels are supplied by a very dense plexus of adrenergic nerves innervating the vascular bed. After then, already in the course of several decades, more than ten types of neurotransimitters including acetylcholine, serotonin, substance P, and calcitonin gene-related peptide, etc., have been observed in these nerves. To determine the origins and pathways of cerebrovascular parasympathetic nerves and sensory nerves, retrograde axonal tracing with immnohistochemstry has been studied. The cerebrovascular parasympathetic nerves originated 1) in the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG), and 2) from the internal carotid ganglion, and also 3) from the otic ganglion. While the cerebrovascular sensory nerves originated 1) in the trigeminal ganglion (TG), and 2) from the internal carotid ganglion, and also 3) from the upper cervical dorsal root ganglia. The neurogenic cerebrovascular vasodilatation was demonstrated in vivo, by the electrical stimulation of the cerebraovascular branches of TG or SPG. This vasodilatation was attenuated not by anti-cholinergic agents but triptans as well as anti-CGRP agents. This implicates the mechanism of pathological neurogenic inflammation and vasodilatation during the migraine attacks.\n",

      "Abs: The pain sensation system is highly conserved among species, thus animal models have been used to investigate relevant tissues. The focus for head-specific pain has been on the primary nociceptive neurons in the trigeminal pathway, i.e. trigeminal ganglia. The secondary nociceptive neurons of the trigeminal pathway, trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC), have not been assessed. We expect different gene expression profiles compared to the homologous spinal cord dorsal horn (SDH), as several signalling substances provoke head-specific pain but not peripheral pain. We aim to provide expression profiles of TNC and SDH, tissues highly relevant for pain- and migraine-studies. We extracted RNA from laser capture microdissected laminae I-V from TNC and SDH from six Wistar rats for RNA-Sequencing. We showed the expression profiles of genes involved in neural signal transmission and found that among all G protein-coupled receptors Gabbr1 was highest expressed in both tissues. Among the migraine-associated genes we showed that Cacna1a, where non-synonyms mutations can cause familial hemiplegic migraine, was highly expressed with a slightly lower expression in TNC than in SDH. To show the genetic differences between the two homologous systems we performed a differential expression analysis, revealing 1696 genes higher and 1895 genes lower expressed genes in TNC than in SDH, of which many were neuronal-related. The high number of differentially expressed genes shows the large genetic difference between the trigeminal and spinothalamic system. Our results contribute to the characterization of nociceptive pathways, which may help us understanding why several signalling molecules cause headache and no peripheral pain.CI - Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

      "Abs: We report a 52-yr-old Korean woman with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) whose diagnosis was confirmed by skin biopsy and the presence of a novel mutation in the NOTCH3 gene. The patient's clinical features were rather unusual in that 1) clinical presentations were only two episodes of stroke and mild dementia unaccompanied by mood disturbances or migraine, and 2) there was no family history. Brain MRI showed T2 hyperintensities in both temporal pole areas in line with the recent suggestion by O'Sullivan et al. that the abnormality could be a radiologic marker of CADASIL. FDG-PET also showed a hypometabolism in the temporal pole areas with an abnormal finding on MRI in addition to the hypometabolism in cortical and subcortical regions. We could learn from this case that CADASIL may be included in the differential diagnoses in patients with vascular dementia associated with a small vessel disease, even in the absence of a family history, especially when there are no known stroke risk factors and when the MRI shows T2 hyperintensity in the temporal pole regions.\n",

The nicotinic acetyl-choline receptor (AChR), ryanodine receptor (RyR), omega-conotoxin receptor (P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel), dihydropyridine receptor (L-type voltage gated calcium channel), and androgen receptor have been found to be affected by autoantibodies and/or genetic anomalies. They reflect on various neurological diseases such as myasthenia gravis, congenital myasthenic syndrome, malignant hyperthermia and central core disease, paraneoplastic myasthenic syndrome, hereditary migraine and ataxias, hypokalemic periodic paralysis, and bulbospinal muscular atrophy. The interaction of calcitonin gene-related peptide with its receptor tends to compensate the dysfunction caused by antibodies to AChR and RyR. One should look for cancers or genetic disorders in the case of the receptor disease implicated in calcium channel function. Recent advances in search for the etiology of these diseases from the standpoints of immunology and genetics have opened an avenue in understanding the functional structure of receptors and the molecular sites responsible for receptor diseases.\n",

      "Title: Why Are Women Prone to Restless Legs Syndrome?LID - 10.3390/ijerph17010368 [doi]LID - 368AB - Restless legs syndrome is a relatively common neurologic disorder considerably more prevalent in women than in men. It is characterized by an inactivity-induced, mostly nocturnal, uncomfortable sensation in the legs and an urge to move them to make the disagreeable sensation disappear. Some known genes contribute to this disorder and the same genes contribute to an overlapping condition-periodic leg movements that occur during sleep and result in insomnia. Dopamine and glutamate transmission in the central nervous system are involved in the pathophysiology, and an iron deficiency has been shown in region-specific areas of the brain. A review of the literature shows that pregnant women are at particular risk and that increased parity is a predisposing factor. Paradoxically, menopause increases the prevalence and severity of symptoms. This implies a complex role for reproductive hormones.

      "PMID:  21514610\n",
      "Abs: INTRODUCTION: MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) is a rare genetic mitochondrial disease which can cause cerebral (cerebrovascular accident, migraine, mental deterioration..), sensorial (bilateral symmetrical deafness) and peripheral (muscular involvement, neuropathy) disorders potentially associated with diabetes, renal or cardiac disorders, or growth retardation. Eighty percent of the patients have the 3243 A>G mutation in the leucine RNA transfer gene. Clinical manifestations leading to discovery of the mutation can be extremely varied, affecting patients of different age groups. CLINICAL CASE: We report the case of a 49-year-old man who presented acute fits of confusion followed by mutism and praxic disorders. History taking revealed recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes, axonal neuropathy, and bilateral symmetrical deafness requiring hearing aids. The initial MRI showed FLAIR sequences with bi-parietal abnormalities, no signs of recent stroke on the DW/B10000 sequences, and basal ganglia calcifications. Blood tests and morphological findings ruled out a vascular origin. Search for lactic acidosis remained constantly negative in blood samples despite positive cerebrospinal fluid samples (N×3). The 3243 A>G mitochondrial DNA mutation was identified. The neuropsychological evaluation revealed a serious dysexecutive syndrome with a major impact on the patient's self sufficiency. CONCLUSION: Neurocognitive disorders are not common in MELAS syndrome. Brain MRI results and the presence of extra-neurological signs can be helpful for diagnosis.CI - Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.\n",

      "PMID:  17929312\n",
      "Abs: Cortical spreading depression is an excitatory wave of depolarization spreading throughout cerebral cortex at a rate of 2-5 mm/min and has been implicated in various neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, migraine aura, and trauma. Although sleepiness or sleep is often induced by these neurological disorders, the cellular and molecular mechanism has remained unclear. To investigate whether and how the sleep-wake behavior is altered by such aberrant brain activity, we induced cortical spreading depression in freely moving rats, monitoring REM and non-REM (NREM) sleep and sleep-associated changes in cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and prostaglandins (PGs). In such a model for aberrant neuronal excitation in the cerebral cortex, the amount of NREM sleep, but not of REM sleep, increased subsequently for several hours, with an up-regulated expression of COX-2 in cortical neurons and considerable production of PGs. A specific inhibitor of COX-2 completely arrested the increase in NREM sleep. These results indicate that up-regulated neuronal COX-2 would be involved in aberrant brain excitation-induced NREM sleep via production of PGs.CI - (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.\n",

      "PMID:  30886212\n",
      "Abs: Ruminative response style is a passive and repetitive way of responding to stress, associated with several disorders. Although twin and candidate gene studies have proven the genetic underpinnings of rumination, no genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been conducted yet. We performed a GWAS on ruminative response style and its two subtypes, brooding and reflection, among 1758 European adults recruited in the general population of Budapest, Hungary, and Manchester, United Kingdom. We evaluated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based, gene-based and gene set-based tests, together with inferences on genes regulated by our most significant SNPs. While no genome-wide significant hit emerged at the SNP level, the association of rumination survived correction for multiple testing with KCTD12 at the gene level, and with the set of genes binding miR-383 at the gene set level. SNP-level results were concordant between the Budapest and Manchester subsamples for all three rumination phenotypes. SNP-level results and their links to brain expression levels based on external databases supported the role of KCTD12, SRGAP3, and SETD5 in rumination, CDH12 in brooding, and DPYSL5, MAPRE3, KCNK3, ATXN7L3B, and TPH2 in reflection, among others. The relatively low sample size is a limitation of our study. Results of the first GWAS on rumination identified genes previously implicated in psychiatric disorders underscoring the transdiagnostic nature of rumination, and pointed to the possible role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum in this cognitive process.\n",

      "Abs: Inherited ion channel mutations can affect the entire nervous system. Many cause paroxysmal disturbances of brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve or skeletal muscle function, with normal neurological development and function in between attacks. To fully understand how mutations of ion channel genes cause disease, we need to know the normal location and function of the channel subunit, consequences of the mutation for biogenesis and biophysical properties, and possible compensatory changes in other channels that contribute to cell or circuit excitability. Animal models of monogenic channelopathies increasingly help our understanding. An important challenge for the future is to determine how more subtle derangements of ion channel function, which arise from the interaction of genetic and environmental influences, contribute to common paroxysmal disorders, including idiopathic epilepsy and migraine, that share features with rare monogenic channelopathies.\n",

      "PMID:  21722971\n",
      "Abs: Secretin family G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are important therapeutic targets for migraine, diabetes, bone disorders, inflammatory disorders and cardiovascular disease. They possess a large N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) known to be the primary ligand-binding determinant. Structural determination of several secretin family GPCR ECDs in complex with peptide ligands has been achieved recently, providing insight into the molecular determinants of hormone binding. Some secretin family GPCRs associate with receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs), resulting in changes to receptor pharmacology. Recently, the first crystal structure of a RAMP ECD in complex with a secretin family GPCR was solved, revealing the elegant mechanism governing receptor selectivity of small molecule antagonists of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor. Here we review the structural basis of ligand binding to secretin family GPCRs, concentrating on recent progress made on the structural basis of RAMP-modified GPCR pharmacology and its implications for rational drug design.CI - Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

      "PMID:  28359950\n",
      "Abs: The trigeminal ganglia (TG) subserving the head and the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) subserving the rest of the body are homologous handling sensory neurons. Differences exist, as a number of signaling substances cause headache but no pain in the rest of the body. To date, very few genes involved in this difference have been identified. We aim to reveal basal gene expression levels in TG and DRG and detect genes that are differentially expressed (DE) between TG and DRG. RNA-Sequencing from six naïve rats describes the whole transcriptome expression profiles of TG and DRG. Differential expression analysis was followed by pathway analysis to identify DE processes between TG and DRG. In total, 64 genes had higher and 55 genes had lower expressed levels in TG than DRG. Higher expressed genes, including S1pr5 and Gjc2, have been related to phospholipase activity. The lower expressed genes, including several Hox genes and Slc5a7, have been related to tyrosine and phenylalanine metabolism. Tissue-specific expression was identified for Gabra6 and Gabrd in TG, and for several Hox genes in DRG. Furthermore, genes that were known to be associated with headache/migraine were mostly moderately to highly expressed in one or both tissues. We present a comprehensive overview of the expression profiles of whole tissue comparison of TG and DRG. Further, we showed DE genes/pathways between TG and DRG, including several known migraine-associated genes. This study provides a basis for further pain-related studies using TG and DRG in rats.CI - Copyright © 2017 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "PMID:  27058678\n",
      "Abs: Migraine and other primary headache disorders affect a large population and cause debilitating pain. Establishing animal models that display behavioral correlates of long-lasting and ongoing headache, the most common and disabling symptom of migraine, is vital for the elucidation of disease mechanisms and identification of drug targets. We have developed a mouse model of headache, using dural application of capsaicin along with a mixture of inflammatory mediators (IScap) to simulate the induction of a headache episode. This elicited intermittent head-directed wiping and scratching as well as the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase in trigeminal ganglion neurons. Interestingly, dural application of IScap preferentially induced FOS protein expression in the excitatory but not inhibitory cervical/medullary dorsal horn neurons. The duration of IScap-induced behavior and the number of FOS-positive neurons correlated positively in individual mice; both were reduced to the control level by the pretreatment of antimigraine drug sumatriptan. Dural application of CGRP(8-37), the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, also effectively blocked IScap-induced behavior, which suggests that the release of endogenous CGRP in the dura is necessary for IScap-induced nociception. These data suggest that dural IScap-induced nocifensive behavior in mice may be mechanistically related to the ongoing headache in humans. In addition, dural application of IScap increased resting time in female mice. Taken together, we present the first detailed study using dural application of IScap in mice. This headache model can be applied to genetically modified mice to facilitate research on the mechanisms and therapeutic targets for migraine headache.\n",

      "PMID:  18022198\n",
      "Abs: CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy) is an inherited small vessel disease causing migraine, early strokes, cognitive impairment and premature death. The disease is caused by NOTCH3 gene puntiform mutations on one of the exons coding for the epidermal-growth factor (EGF)-like repeats of the extracellular domain of the NOTCH3 receptor. Mutations have been reported with higher frequency on some exons, and never on 6 out of a total of 23. We report for the first time a mutation (c.3471C>G) on exon 21 of the NOTCH3 gene that leads to a cysteine substitution (p.1131C>W) in the EGF-like repeat 29 of the NOTCH3 receptor extracellular domain, and that is responsible for CADASIL in a functionally independent elderly man who came to our attention at the age of 79 because of a minor stroke. CADASIL suspicion aroused only from the finding of severe white matter changes extended to the temporopolar region on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging. This case report underlines that, when CADASIL is suspected, molecular analysis should be performed on all the NOTCH3 exons coding for EGF-like repeats and not be limited to those where mutations have been found with higher frequency, and that the disease may be encountered also in mildly symptomatic elderly patients. The newly reported mutation might sustain a milder expressivity of the disease.\n",

      "PMID:  18238816\n",
      "Abs: Voltage-gated K+channels of the K(V)7 (KCNQ) family have been identified in the last 10-15 years by discovering the causative genes for three autosomal dominant diseases: cardiac arrhythmia (long QT syndrome) with or without congenital deafness (KCNQ1), a neonatal epilepsy (KCNQ2 and KCNQ3) and progressive deafness alone (KCNQ4). A fifth member of this gene family (KCNQ5) is not affected in a disease so far. Four genes (KCNQ2-5) are expressed in the nervous system. This review is focused on recent findings on the neuronal K(V)7 channelopathies, in particular on benign familial neonatal seizures (BFNS) and peripheral nerve hyperexcitability (PNH, neuromyotonia, myokymia) caused by KCNQ2 mutations. The phenotypic spectrum associated with KCNQ2 mutations is probably broader than initially thought, as patients with severe epilepsies and developmental delay, or with Rolando epilepsy have been described. With regard to the underlying molecular pathophysiology, it has been shown that mutations with very subtle changes restricted to subthreshold voltages can cause BFNS thereby proving in a human disease model that this is the relevant voltage range for these channels to modulate neuronal firing. The two mutations associated with PNH induce much more severe channel dysfunction with a dominant negative effect on wild type (WT) channels. Finally, K(V)7 channels present interesting targets for new therapeutic approaches to diseases caused by neuronal hyperexcitability, such as epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and migraine. The molecular mechanism of K(V)7 activation by retigabine, which is in phase III clinical testing to treat pharmacoresistant focal epilepsies, has been recently elucidated as a stabilization of the open conformation by binding to the pore region.\n",

      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Genetic and environmental risk factors and gene-environment interactions are linked to higher likelihood of developing schizophrenia in accordance with the neurodevelopmental model of disease; little is known about risk factors and early development in early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) and very early-onset schizophrenia (VEOS). METHODS: We present a case-control study of a sample of 21 patients with EOS/VEOS and a control group of 21 patients with migraine, recruited from the Child Neuropsychiatry Unit, Department of Neurologic and Psychiatric Science, University of Bari, Italy. The aim was to assess the statistical association between VEOS/EOS and family history for psychiatric disorders, obstetric complications and childhood developmental abnormalities using 2 × 2 tables and a Chi Squared or Fisher test. RESULTS: The results show a statistical association between EOS/VEOS and schizophrenia and related disorders (P = 0.02) and personality disorders (P = 0.003) in relatives, and between EOS/VEOS and developmental abnormalities of early relational skills (P = 0.008) and learning (P = 0.04); there is not a statistically relevant difference between cases and controls (P > 0.05) for any obstetric complications (pre, peri and postpartum). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the significant role of familial liability but not of obstetric complications in the pathogenesis of VEOS/EOS; the association between childhood developmental abnormalities and EOS/VEOS supports the neurodevelopmental model of disease.\n",

      "Abs: CADASIL is an inherited small vessel disease of the brain caused by mutations of the NOTCH3 gene encoding a receptor of smooth muscle cells and pericytes within the wall of arterioles and capillaries. The mutated gene is responsible for accumulation of NOTCH3 protein and aggregation of various proteins in the vascular wall. The disease occurs during mid-adulthood and is responsible for attacks of migraine with aura, ischemic stroke, mood disorders and cognitive impairment ranging from mild alterations of attentional performances and executive functions to severe dementia. The disease develops in adults with aging and is responsible at the latest stage of gait and balance troubles associated with cognitive impairment that may lead to severe disability and dependence. MRI shows widespread white matter lesions that may involve the anterior part of temporal lobes often associated with small cerebral infarcts and with microbleeds. The clinical severity is related to accumulation of small infarcts and the development of cerebral atrophy over time. The diagnosis of the disease is confirmed by genetic testing or skin biopsy.\n",

      "Abs: Vestibular disorders comprise a heterogeneous group of diseases with transient or permanent loss of vestibular function. Vestibulopathy is in most cases associated with migraine, Ménière disease, hereditary ataxias, or sensorineural hearing loss. We identified two brothers and their first cousin affected by hearing loss and episodic vertigo. The brothers were homozygous STRC nonsense variant [c.4027 C > T, p.(Q1343*)], whereas their first cousin was compound heterozygous for the STRC nonsense variant and a 97 kb deletion spanning the entire STRC gene. Clinical investigations confirmed pathological vestibular responses in addition to a characteristic DFNB16 hearing loss. The STRC gene encodes Stereocilin in the cochlea and in the vestibular organ where it ensheathes the kinocilium of the otolithic membranes. Stereocilin is associated with the gel overlaying the vestibular kinocilia, suggesting a role for the protein in sensing balance and spatial orientation. Our findings support such a function for Stereocilin in the vestibular organ and expand the phenotype associated with DFNB16.\n",

      "PMID:  25596066\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: Paroxysmal tonic upward gaze was initially described as a benign phenomenon with negative investigations and eventual complete resolution of symptoms. Later publications demonstrated that a similar clinical picture may arise from structural brain lesions, channelopathies, neurotransmitter disorders, and epileptic seizures. CACNA1A related disorders manifest as a wide spectrum of paroxysmal neurological disorders: episodic ataxia 2, hemiplegic migraine, benign paroxysmal torticollis of infancy, and paroxysmal vertigo. Paroxysmal tonic upward gaze as a phenomenon in patients with mutations in the CACNA1A gene has only been reported once. METHODS: We describe three patients with multiple episodes of paroxysmal tonic upward gaze that appeared during the first months of life. In addition the patients demonstrated motor and language delay and cerebellar ataxia. A sequence analysis of the CACNA1A gene in one patient and whole exome sequencing in the other patients were performed. RESULTS: Sequence analysis of the CACNA1A gene in one patient and whole exome sequencing in the two other patients revealed 3 different de-novo mutations in the CACNA1A gene. CONCLUSION: CACNA1A mutations should be evaluated in infants and young children with paroxysmal tonic upgaze especially if associated with developmental delay, cerebellar signs, and other types of paroxysmal event.CI - Copyright © 2015 European Paediatric Neurology Society.

      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the delay in diagnosis, residual motor signs, and nonmotor signs of dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) using literature and our own pilot data. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: We searched the MEDLINE database for patients with clinically typical DRD and/or guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I gene mutations from 1952 to 2011 and examined a pilot cohort of 23 outpatients with DRD and guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I gene mutations. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 101 reports describing 576 cases. Excluding cases without proven guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I gene mutations as well as homozygous and asymptomatic mutation carriers resulted in 352 cases. The mean (SD) ages at onset were 11.6 (13.4) years (literature) and 9.4 (7.7) years (pilot study). The average (SD) delays in diagnosis were 13.5 (13.3) years (literature) and 15.5 (16.3) years (pilot study); using all literature cases, they were 9.1 (7.5) years before and 15.2 (13.7) years after identification of the guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I gene. Residual motor signs in patients receiving therapy were found in 28% (literature) and 39% (pilot study). Residual motor signs in the literature comprised dystonic (20%) and parkinsonian (11%) symptoms, as well as complications such as contractures or unnecessary surgical procedures. Information on nonmotor signs was given for 70 patients in the literature. Of these, 34% had depression, 19% anxiety, and 9% obsessive-compulsive disorder. Six of our own cases (32%) reported 1 or more nonmotor signs including depression and migraine. CONCLUSIONS: The delay in diagnosis is long, despite the well-known etiology and availability of genetic testing and specific therapy. A sizable number of treated patients have residual motor signs, nonmotor signs, and complications resulting from the lack of timely therapy or unnecessary procedures.\n",

      "Abs: PURPOSE: The pineal gland plays an important role in biological rhythms, circadian and circannual variations, which are key aspects in several headache disorders. OVERVIEW: Melatonin, the main pineal secreting hormone, has been extensively studied in primary and secondary headache disorders. Altered melatonin secretion occurs in many headache syndromes. Experimental data show pineal gland and melatonin both interfere in headache animal models, decreasing trigeminal activation. Melatonin has been shown to regulate CGRP and control its release. DISCUSSION: Melatonin has been used successfully as a treatment for migraine, cluster headaches and other headaches. There is a rationale for including the pineal gland as a relevant brain structure in the mechanisms of headache pathophysiology, and melatonin as a treatment option in primary headache.\n",

      "PMID:  11474425\n",
      "Abs: In the last decade, advances in molecular genetics and cellular electrophysiology have increased our understanding of ion channel function. A number of diseases termed \"channelopathies\" have been discovered that are caused by ion channel dysfunction. Channelopathies can be caused by autoimmune, iatrogenic, toxic or genetic mechanisms. Mutations in genes encoding ion channel proteins that disrupt channel function are now the most commonly identified cause of channelopathies, perhaps because gene disruption is readily detected by the methods of molecular genetics. Ion channels are abundant in the central nervous system (CNS), but CNS channelopathies are rare; however, they overlap with some important neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, ataxia, migraine, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. It is possible that more CNS channelopathies will be discovered when additional ion channels are characterized and the complex mechanisms of brain function are better understood. At present, increased knowledge of the identity, structure and function of ion channels is facilitating diagnosis and treatment of many channelopathies.\n",

      "PMID:  24042216\n",
      "Abs: Like most neurotransmitters, serotonin possesses a simple structure. However, the pharmacological consequences are more complex and diverse. Serotonin is involved in numerous functions in the human body including the control of appetite, sleep, memory and learning, temperature regulation, mood, behavior, cardiovascular function, muscle contraction, endocrine regulation, and depression. Low levels of serotonin may be associated with several disorders, namely increase in aggressive and angry behaviors, clinical depression, Parkinson's disease, obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders, migraine, irritable bowel syndrome, tinnitus, and bipolar disease. These effects are mediated via different serotonin (5-HT) receptors. In this review, we will focus on the last discovered member of this serotonin receptor family, the 5-HT7 receptor. This receptor belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily and was cloned two decades ago. Later, different splice variants were described but no major functional differences have been described so far. All 5-HT7 receptor variants are coupled to Gαs proteins and stimulate cAMP formation. Recently, several interacting proteins have been reported, which can influence receptor signaling and trafficking.\n",

      "PMID:  27919769\n",
      "Abs: Migraine with aura is a subtype of migraine characterized by transient neurological disturbances that usually precede headache. Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is the likely pathophysiological correlate of the aura phase of migraine, found in common and rare forms of migraine, such as familial hemiplegic migraine. CSD is a depolarization wave that propagates across the cerebral gray matter transiently suppressing neuronal activity. Prophylactic treatments for migraine, such as topiramate or valproate, reduce the number of CSD events. We evaluated changes in gene expression in rat cortex and brainstem after inducing CSD in the cortex, with and without a prophylactic treatment with topiramate or valproate. CSD induction showed similar transcriptomic profiles with and without treatment in cortex, involving genes related to hormone stimulus, apoptosis, synaptic transmission, and interleukin signaling. In brainstem, CSD with and without treatment, although to a lesser extent, also induced gene expression changes involving genes related to apoptosis. Half of the genes altered in brainstem after CSD were also differentially expressed in the same direction in cortex. No differences in gene expression were identified after CSD as a consequence of the treatments, neither in cortex nor in brainstem. PERSPECTIVE: Our results suggest that early after triggering the CSD, similar consequences are seen at the genetic level with or without prophylactic treatment. Gene expression changes induced by CSD in cortex and brainstem may help to better understand the underlying mechanisms and identify targets for therapeutic approaches.CI - Copyright © 2016 American Pain Society.

METHODS: Oxytocin receptor expression and co-localization with calcitonin gene-related peptide was investigated in rat trigeminal ganglion using immunohistochemistry. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the effects of facial electrocutaneous stimulation and adjuvant-induced inflammation of the temporomandibular joint on oxytocin receptor expression in the trigeminal ganglion. Finally, the effects of oxytocin on capsaicin-induced calcitonin gene-related peptide release from dural nociceptors were investigated using isolated rat dura mater. RESULTS: Oxytocin receptor immunoreactivity was present in rat trigeminal neurons. The vast majority of oxytocin receptor immunoreactive neurons co-expressed calcitonin gene-related peptide. Both electrocutaneous stimulation and adjuvant-induced inflammation led to a rapid upregulation of oxytocin receptor protein expression in trigeminal ganglion neurons. Oxytocin significantly and dose-dependently decreased capsaicin-induced calcitonin gene-related peptide release from dural nociceptors. CONCLUSION: Oxytocin receptor expression in calcitonin gene-related peptide containing trigeminal ganglion neurons, and the blockade of calcitonin gene-related peptide release from trigeminal dural afferents suggests that activation of these receptors may provide therapeutic benefit in patients with migraine and other primary headache disorders.CI - © International Headache Society 2015.\n",

      "Title: Clinicopathological and genetic studies of two further Italian families with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy\n",
      "PMID:  8841656\n",
      "Abs: We report on two Italian families with an early-adult onset autosomal dominant disorder, characterized by leukoencephalopathy, migraine, psychiatric disturbances, stroke and dementia. These findings fulfill the diagnostic criteria for cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) syndrome. Moreover, to confirm the CADASIL gene location to 19p12, we performed a linkage analysis with four microsatellite markers. The results of the genetic study gave positive but not significant lod scores, indicating only weak evidence of a linkage with 19p12. In one autopsy case, we found extensive ischemic changes due to the selective involvement of the small muscular arteries of the cerebral white matter. The lesions consisted of a thickening of the media with deposition of granular eosinophilic material. Ultrastructural examination of the arterial walls showed graded damage to smooth muscle cells, mostly of the longitudinal layer, and an abnormal proliferation of basal lamina components. Immunocytochemical analysis showed strong reactivity using antibodies to collagen IV and smooth myosin proteins. The results suggest a primary involvement of the smooth muscle cells of small cerebral arteries, with a secondary alteration of basal lamina components and elastic tissue.\n",

      "PMID:  29154802\n",
      "Abs: ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Phaleria macrocarpa (Scheff) Boerl, is a famous traditional medicinal plant which exhibited cytotoxicity against various cancerous cells. Traditionally, P. macrocarpa has been used to control cancer, impotency, hemorrhoids, diabetes mellitus, allergies, liver and heart disease, kidney disorders, blood diseases, acne, stroke, migraine, and various skin diseases. AIM OF THE STUDY: Recent studies have demonstrated a potent anticancer potential of P. macrocarpa, especially against HeLa cell. The objective of this study was to investigate the regulation of miRNAs on MDA-MB-231 treated with P. macrocarpa ethyl acetate fraction (PMEAF). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The regulation of miRNAs on MDA-MB-231 cells treated with PMEAF was studied through IIlumina, Hi-Seq. 2000 platform of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and various in silico bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: The PMEAF treatment against MDA-MB-231 cells identified 10 upregulated and 10 downregulated miRNAs. A set of 606 target genes of 10 upregulated miRNAs and 517 target genes of 10 downregulated miRNAs were predicted based on computational and validated databases by using miRGate DB Query. Meanwhile, results from DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.8 specified the functional annotation of the upregulated miRNAs involvement in cancer pathway by suppressing the oncogenes and downregulating miRNAs by expressing the tumour suppressor genes in the regulation of apoptosis pathway. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the results of this study proved that PMEAF is a promising anticancer agent with high cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and it induced apoptotic cell death mechanism through the regulation of miRNAs. PMEAF might be the best candidate for developing more potent anticancer drugs or chemo preventive supplements.CI - Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "PMID:  17234214\n",
      "Abs: Mycoplasmas are the smallest of the known self-replicating organisms. They lack cell walls and are associated with numerous diseases in humans and animals. We are exploring the possibility that infection by Mycoplasma may induce the inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that is MS. The presence of specific Mycoplasma species DNA was sought in brain, serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) and other neurological diseases (OND) including inflammatory disorders. The MS samples from patients with active and progressive MS, as well as in remission, a variety of other neurological disease controls, including inflammatory CNS diseases such as meningitis, cryptococcal meningitis and encephalitis and other neurological disorders such as migraine were also examined. Clinical samples were provided by the National Neurological Research Specimen Bank and the Human Brain and Spinal Fluid Resource Centre, Los Angeles. Analysis was carried out by conventional PCR using Mycoplasma-specific primers (McAuliffe et al., 2005) that target the 16S rDNA gene in Mycoplasma species. The Mycoplasma-specific primers could detect 102 Mycoplasma species. In this study, 30 samples of human brain and 57 pairs of serum and CSF and were examined. No Mycoplasma-specific nucleic acid sequence was detected, and the consistent observation of an endogenous gene, human serum albumin (HSA), as a positive control documented the adequacy of the method. Real-time PCR analysis of serum and CSF was done also targeting utilizing the Mycoplasma 16S rDNA gene, and this also demonstrated the lack of Mycoplasma in these samples. The presence of Mycoplasma at extraneural sites in MS patients is now being explored.\n",

      "Abs: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is one of the most common hereditary forms of stroke, and migraine with aura, mood disorders, or dementia, are also frequently found in these patients. Missense mutations in the Notch3 gene that create or destroy cysteine residues, have been found in most cases with a family history of the disease, although a few sporadic cases harbouring Notch3 mutations have also been described. Here, we describe a 44-year-old patient with clinical features of CADASIL who was a carrier of a new Notch3 mutation: cys128-->gly. Both parents were alive and healthy, and negative for the mutation. This case illustrates the interest of analysing the Notch3 gene in cases with clinical features of CADASIL, even in the absence of a family history of the disease.\n",

      "PMID:  20734317\n",
      "Abs: Valproate (VPA) has been used for decades in the treatment of epilepsy and migraine. However, maternal administration of VPA during pregnancy increases susceptibility to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in the offspring. The aim of this study was to investigate the methylation modification and its effects on the activity of Wnt/β-catenin pathway in the rat brain prenatally exposed to VPA. We exposed the rats in early pregnancy to VPA and found that the prenatal VPA exposure, in comparison with the prenatal vehicle exposure, induced demethylation in the promoter regions of wnt1 and wnt2, but not in those of Wnt inhibitory factor-1 and Dickkopf 1, in the prefrontal cortexes and hippocampi of the offspring. Consequently, both mRNA and protein expression of wnt1 and wnt2 were increased. Furthermore, the activity of Wnt/β-catenin pathway was upregulated, as indicated by the increased levels of β-catenin, hence the growing expression of its target genes. This work suggested an epigenetic action via which VPA, when administered in early pregnancy, induced dysregulation of signaling pathway, further facilitating susceptibility to ASDs.\n",

      "PMID:  19854154\n",
      "Abs: The CACNA1A gene encodes the poreforming, voltage-sensitive subunit of the voltage-dependent Ca(v)2.1 calcium channel. Mutations in this gene have been linked to several human disorders, including familial hemiplegic migraine type 1, episodic ataxia type 2, and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6. In mice, mutations of the homolog Cacna1a cause recessively inherited phenotypes in tottering, rolling Nagoya, rocker, and leaner mice. Here we describe two knockdown mice with 28.4+/-3.4% and 13.8+/-3.3% of the wild-type Ca(v)2.1 quantity. 28.4+/-3.4% level mutants displayed ataxia, absence-like seizures and progressive cerebellar atrophy, although they had a normal life span. Mutants with 13.8+/-3.3% level exhibited ataxia severer than the 28.4+/-3.4% level mutants, absence-like seizures and additionally paroxysmal dyskinesia, and died premature around 3 weeks of age. These results indicate that knock down of Ca(v)2.1 quantity to 13.8+/-3.3% of the wild-type level are sufficient to induce the all neurological disorders observed in natural occurring Cacna1a mutants. These knockdown animals with Ca(v)2.1 calcium channels intact can contribute to functional studies of the molecule in the disease.\n",

      "PMID:  20138852\n",
      "Abs: Activation of trigeminal nerves and release of neuropeptides that promote inflammation are implicated in the underlying pathology of migraine and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders. The overall response of trigeminal nerves to peripheral inflammatory stimuli involves a balance between enzymes that promote inflammation, kinases, and those that restore homeostasis, phosphatases. The goal of this study was to determine the effects of a cocoa-enriched diet on the expression of key inflammatory proteins in trigeminal ganglion neurons under basal and inflammatory conditions. Rats were fed a control diet or an isocaloric diet enriched in cocoa for 14days prior to an injection of noxious stimuli to cause acute or chronic excitation of trigeminal neurons. In animals fed a cocoa-enriched diet, basal levels of the mitogen-activated kinase (MAP) phosphatases MKP-1 and MKP-3 were elevated in neurons. Importantly, the stimulatory effects of acute or chronic peripheral inflammation on neuronal expression of the MAPK p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) were significantly repressed in response to cocoa. Similarly, dietary cocoa significantly suppressed basal neuronal expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) as well as stimulated levels of the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), proteins implicated in the underlying pathology of migraine and TMJ disorders. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that a dietary supplement can cause upregulation of MKP, and that cocoa can prevent inflammatory responses in trigeminal ganglion neurons. Furthermore, our data provide evidence that cocoa contains biologically active compounds that would be beneficial in the treatment of migraine and TMJ disorders.CI - Copyright 2010 Elsevier B.V.

      "PMID:  27005779\n",
      "Abs: Variants in CACNA1A that encodes the pore-forming α1-subunit of human voltage-gated Cav2.1 (P/Q-type) Ca(2+)channels cause several autosomal-dominant neurologic disorders, including familial hemiplegic migraine type 1, episodic ataxia type 2, and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6. To identify modifiers of incoordination in movement disorders, we performed a large-scale functional RNAi screen, using the Caenorhabditis elegansstrain CB55, which carries a truncating mutation in the unc-2gene, the worm ortholog for the human CACNA1A The screen was carried out by the feeding method in 96-well liquid culture format, using the ORFeome v1.1 feeding library, and time-lapse imaging of worms in liquid culture was used to assess changes in thrashing behavior. We looked for genes that, when silenced, either ameliorated the slow and uncoordinated phenotype of unc-2, or interacted to produce a more severe phenotype. Of the 350 putative hits from the primary screen, 37 genes consistently showed reproducible results. At least 75% of these are specifically expressed in the C. elegansneurons. Functional network analysis and gene ontology revealed overrepresentation of genes involved in development, growth, locomotion, signal transduction, and vesicle-mediated transport. We have expanded the functional network of genes involved in neurodegeneration leading to cerebellar ataxia related to unc-2/CACNA1A, further confirming the involvement of the transforming growth factor β pathway and adding a novel signaling cascade, the Notch pathway.CI - © The Author(s) 2016.\n",

      "PMID:  19182766\n",
      "Abs: PURPOSE: Mutations in the 1A-subunit of the brain P/Q-type calcium channel gene CACNA1A are responsible for spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6), familial haemiplegic migraine (FHM) and episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2). Considerable clinical and genetic overlap exists between these 3 allelic disorders. Clinical findings are varied and may include nystagmus. OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical phenotype and identify a causative mutation in a family who presented when the youngest member was diagnosed with apparent isolated congenital nystagmus (age 3 months). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 8 patients from one family underwent detailed clinical phenotyping comprising; ophthalmic and neurological examination, nystagmology, electrodiagnostic tests and brain imaging. The CACNA1A gene was screened for mutations by direct sequencing in one patient. Co-segregation of the disease and an identified sequence variation was shown using direct sequencing. RESULTS: Phenotyping revealed isolated atypical nystagmus in 4 family members and nystagmus in addition to late onset ataxia in 1 family member. Direct sequencing of the CACNA1A gene identified a novel missense mutation; (c.4110T>G p.Phe1370Leu (NM_000068.3)). CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that a mutation in the intracellular domain between s4 and s5 of repeat 3 can cause atypical nystagmus/cerebellar phenotypes, including isolated nystagmus in an infant. We also illustrate the necessity for detailed examination of relatives in cases of apparent isolated congenital nystagmus.\n",

      "PMID:  20735403\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mutations of SCN1A, the gene encoding the pore-forming subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel Na(V) 1.1, have been associated with a spectrum of genetic epilepsies and a familial form of migraine. Several mutant Na(V) 1.1 channels exhibit increased persistent current due to incomplete inactivation and this biophysical defect may contribute to altered neuronal excitability in these disorders. Here, we investigated the ability of ranolazine to preferentially inhibit increased persistent current evoked by mutant Na(V) 1.1 channels. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Human wild-type (WT) and mutant Na(V) 1.1 channels were expressed heterologously in human tsA201 cells and whole-cell patch clamp recording was used to assess tonic and use-dependent ranolazine block. KEY RESULTS: Ranolazine (30 µM) did not affect WT Na(V) 1.1 channel current density, activation or steady-state fast inactivation but did produce mild slowing of recovery from inactivation. Ranolazine blocked persistent current with 16-fold selectivity over tonic block of peak current and 3.6-fold selectivity over use-dependent block of peak current. Similar selectivity was observed for ranolazine block of increased persistent current exhibited by Na(V) 1.1 channel mutations representing three distinct clinical syndromes, generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (R1648H, T875M), severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (R1648C, F1661S) and familial hemiplegic migraine type 3 (L263V, Q1489K). In vitro application of achievable brain concentrations (1, 3 µM) to cells expressing R1648H channels was sufficient to suppress channel activation during slow voltage ramps, consistent with inhibition of persistent current. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings support the feasibility of using selective suppression of increased persistent current as a potential new therapeutic strategy for familial neurological disorders associated with certain sodium channel mutations.CI - © 2010 The Authors.

      "PMID:  24594579\n",
      "Abs: Inherited and de novo genomic imbalances at chromosome 16p11.2 are associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but the causative genes remain unknown. Among the genes located in this region, PRRT2 codes for a member of the synaptic SNARE complex that allows the release of synaptic vesicles. PRRT2 is a candidate gene for ASD since homozygote mutations are associated with intellectual disability and heterozygote mutations cause benign infantile seizures, paroxysmal dyskinesia, or hemiplegic migraine. Here, we explored the contribution of PRRT2 mutations in ASD by screening its coding part in a large sample of 1578 individuals including 431 individuals with ASD, 186 controls and 961 individuals from the human genome Diversity Panel. We detected 24 nonsynonymous variants, 1 frameshift (A217PfsX8) and 1 in-frame deletion of 6 bp (p.A361_P362del). The frameshift mutation was observed in a control with no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. The p.A361_P362del was observed in two individuals with autism from sub-Saharan African origin. Overall, the frequency of PRRT2 deleterious variants was not different between individuals with ASD and controls. Remarkably, PRRT2 displays a highly significant excess of nonsynonymous (pN) vs synonymous (pS) mutations in Asia (pN/pS = 4.85) and Europe (pN/pS = 1.62) compared with Africa (pN/pS = 0.26; Asia vs Africa: P = 0.000087; Europe vs Africa P = 0.00035; Europe vs Asia P = P = 0.084). We also showed that whole genome amplification performed through rolling cycle amplification could artificially introduce the A217PfsX8 mutation indicating that this technology should not be performed prior to PRRT2 mutation screening. In summary, our results do not support a role for PRRT2 coding sequence variants in ASD, but provide an ascertainment of its genetic variability in worldwide populations that should help researchers and clinicians to better investigate the role of PRRT2 in human diseases.\n",

      "PMID:  9292694\n",
      "Abs: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a non-arterio-atherosclerotic, non-amyloidotic arteriopathy affecting preferentially the small arteries and arterioles of the brain. The morphologic hallmark is the presence of a characteristic granular alteration of the arterial media that ultrastructurally corresponds to the accumulation of electron-dense material surrounding the smooth muscle cells. Although the presence of this granular osmiophilic material (GOM) was originally described as limited to brain vessels, identical electron microscopic findings have been demonstrated in the media of peripheral tissue arteries, allowing for a pathologic diagnosis of the disease by a simple skin, muscle or nerve biopsy. We report some atypical features identified in our CADASIL patients that broaden the phenotypic expression of this disease. Firstly, we identified a cortical infarct in an otherwise typical CADASIL patient. Secondly, we observed GOM in skin arteries of a 30-year-old man with hemiplegic migraine, the son of a woman who had died with CADASIL. This confirms that it may be possible to diagnose the disease at a preclinical stage by the ultrastructural evaluation of peripheral tissue biopsy material, particularly for individuals for whom there is a supporting family history. Thirdly, ultrastructural examination of the skin, and subcutaneous and striated muscle of an unrelated and apparently sporadic patient with neuropathologic and neuroradiologic evidence of CADASIL in meningeal and cerebral vessels failed to reveal diagnostic lesions in peripheral arteries. Thus, the possibility of a false-negative pathologic diagnosis in patients with a clinicoradiologic diagnosis of CADASIL, if one relies solely on a peripheral tissue biopsy, does exist. Additionally, we have identified heat shock proteins (Hsp70 and alphaB crystallin) and ubiquitin in the vascular myocytes of affected arteries. <alpha>B crystallin also seemed to be deposited extracellularly, which suggests that GOM also might be immunoreactive for alphaB crystallin.\n",

      "Abs: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a treatment option with proved effectiveness especially in drug resist depression. It is used in functional brain mapping before neurosurgery operations and diagnostic of corticospinal tract transmission. Many studies are performed to evaluate rTMS using in treatment of obsessive - compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, autism, strokes, tinnitus, Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, cranial traumas. Moreover rTMS was used in treatment of multiple sclerosis, migraine, dystonia. Electromagnetical field generated by rTMS penetrate skin of the scalp and infiltrate brain tissues to a depth of 2 cm, cause neurons depolarization and generating motor, cognitive and affective effects. Depending on the stimulation frequency rTMS can stimuli or inhibit brain cortex. rTMS mechanism of action remains elusive. Probably it is connected with enhancement of neurotransmitters, modulation of signals transductions pathways in Central Nervous System, gene transcription and release of neuroprotective substances. Studies with use of animals revealed that rTMS stimulation can generate brain changes similar to those seen after electric shock therapy without provoking seizures. The aim of presenting study was to analyze actual researches evaluating rTMS use in treatment of psychiatric and neurological diseases.CI - © 2016 MEDPRESS.\n",

      "Abs: As a consequence of the genomic revolution, a large number of publications describing paroxysmal movement disorders have been published in the last few years, shedding light on their molecular pathology. Routine gene testing is not necessary to guide treatment for typical forms of paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD), paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD), and episodic ataxia type 1 or 2. It can, however, be helpful in the management of atypical or complex cases, especially for genetic counselling, treatment strategies, and the offer of preimplantation genetic diagnosis. Antiepileptic drugs remain the treatment of choice for PKD and episodic ataxia type 1, benzodiazepines are often useful for PNKD, and episodic ataxia type 2 benefits from acetazolamide regardless of the genetic etiology.

      "PMID:  22036850\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: Inherited ataxias are heterogeneous disorders affecting both children and adults. The primary cause can be identified in about half of the patients and only very few can receive causative therapy. METHODS: The authors performed sequencing of known Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) deficiency genes in 22 patients with unexplained recessive or sporadic ataxia. RESULTS: CABC1/ADCK3 mutations were detected in four patients and two siblings presenting with cerebellar ataxia, epilepsy and muscle symptoms. Spasticity, dystonia, tremor and migraine were variably present; cognitive impairment was severe in early childhood cases, but was absent in adults. In contrast to previous reports, two of the patients had a later-onset, very mild phenotype and remained ambulatory in their late forties. Muscle biopsy revealed lipid accumulation, mitochondrial proliferation and cytochrome c oxidase-deficient fibres, but no typical ragged red fibres. Respiratory-chain enzyme activities and CoQ10 were decreased in severely affected patients but remained normal in a mildly affected patient at 46 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: These observations highlight the importance of screening for a potentially treatable cause, CABC1/ADCK3 mutations, not only in severe childhood-onset ataxia, but also in patients with mild cerebellar ataxia in adult life.\n",

      "PMID:  17344407\n",
      "Abs: The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from the trigeminal ganglion has been established as a key player in the pathogenesis of migraine. In this study, we provide evidence that the responsiveness of neuronal CGRP receptors is strongly enhanced in vitro and in vivo by expression of human receptor activity-modifying protein-1 (hRAMP1), an obligatory subunit of the CGRP receptor. We first demonstrated that activation of CGRP receptors on cultured trigeminal ganglion neurons increased endogenous CGRP mRNA levels and promoter activity. The promoter activation was cAMP dependent and blocked by the antagonist BIBN4096BS [1-piperidinecarboxamide, N-[2-[[5-amino-l-[[4-(4-pyridinyl)-l-piperazinyl]carbonyl]pentyl]amino]-1-[(3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxyphenyl)methyl]-2-oxoethyl]-4-(1,4-dihydro-2-oxo-3(2H)-quinazolinyl)], a new antimigraine drug. Gene transfer using an adenoviral hRAMP1 expression vector increased the maximal production of cAMP by 1.8 +/- 0.2-fold and decreased the EC50 to 2.3 +/- 0.8 nM from 9.0 +/- 5.9 nM and 15.6 +/- 5.2 nM in uninfected and control-infected cultures, respectively. To establish whether RAMP1 is limiting in vivo as indicated from the culture studies, a transgenic mouse expressing hRAMP1 in the nervous system was generated. After CGRP injection into the whiskerpad, the hRAMP1 transgenic mice displayed 2.2 +/- 0.2-fold greater plasma extravasation, which is a measure of neurogenic inflammation. These results demonstrate that RAMP1 is functionally rate limiting for CGRP receptor activity in the trigeminal ganglion, which raises the possibility that elevated RAMP1 might sensitize some individuals to CGRP actions in migraine.\n",

      "PMID:  15496428\n",
      "Abs: Paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) is characterized by spontaneous hyperkinetic attacks that are precipitated by alcohol, coffee, stress and fatigue. We report mutations in the myofibrillogenesis regulator 1 (MR-1) gene causing PNKD in 50 individuals from eight families. The mutations cause changes (Ala to Val) in the N-terminal region of two MR-1 isoforms. The MR-1L isoform is specifically expressed in brain and is localized to the cell membrane while the MR-1S isoform is ubiquitously expressed and shows diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear localization. Bioinformatic analysis reveals that the MR-1 gene is homologous to the hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase (HAGH) gene. HAGH functions in a pathway to detoxify methylglyoxal, a compound present in coffee and alcoholic beverages and produced as a by-product of oxidative stress. Our results suggest a mechanism whereby alcohol, coffee and stress may act as precipitants of attacks in PNKD. Stress response pathways will be important areas for elucidation of episodic disease genetics where stress is a common precipitant of many common disorders like epilepsy, migraine and cardiac arrhythmias.\n",

      "Title: Isolation of Potent CGRP Neutralizing Antibodies Using Four Simple Assays\n",
      "PMID:  26450103\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a small neuropeptide and a potent vasodilator that is widely associated with chronic pain and migraine. An antibody that inhibits CGRP function would be a potential therapeutic for treatment of these disorders. Here we describe the isolation of highly potent antibodies to CGRP from phage and ribosome display libraries and characterization of their epitope, species cross-reactivity, kinetics, and functional activity. Homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) binding assays identified antibodies with the desired species cross-reactivity from naïve libraries, and HTRF epitope competition assays were used to characterize and group scFv by epitope. The functional inhibition of CGRP and species cross-reactivity of purified scFv and antibodies were subsequently confirmed using cAMP assays. We show that epitope competition assays could be used as a surrogate for functional cell-based assays during affinity maturation, in combination with scFv off-rate ranking by biolayer interferometry (BLI). This is the first time it has been shown that off-rate ranking can be predictive of functional activity for anti-CGRP antibodies. Here we demonstrate how, by using just four simple assays, diverse panels of antibodies to CGRP can be identified. These assay formats have potential utility in the identification of antibodies to other therapeutic targets.CI - © 2015 Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.\n",

      "PMID:  26716990\n",
      "Abs: Mutations in the CACNA1A gene, encoding the pore-forming CaV2.1 (P/Q-type) channel α1A subunit, result in heterogeneous human neurological disorders, including familial and sporadic hemiplegic migraine along with episodic and progressive forms of ataxia. Hemiplegic Migraine (HM) mutations induce gain-of-channel function, mainly by shifting channel activation to lower voltages, whereas ataxia mutations mostly produce loss-of-channel function. However, some HM-linked gain-of-function mutations are also associated to congenital ataxia and/or cerebellar atrophy, including the deletion of a highly conserved phenylalanine located at the S6 pore region of α1A domain III (ΔF1502). Functional studies of ΔF1502 CaV2.1 channels, expressed in Xenopus oocytes, using the non-physiological Ba2+ as the charge carrier have only revealed discrete alterations in channel function of unclear pathophysiological relevance. Here, we report a second case of congenital ataxia linked to the ΔF1502 α1A mutation, detected by whole-exome sequencing, and analyze its functional consequences on CaV2.1 human channels heterologously expressed in mammalian tsA-201 HEK cells, using the physiological permeant ion Ca2+. ΔF1502 strongly decreases the voltage threshold for channel activation (by ~ 21 mV), allowing significantly higher Ca2+ current densities in a range of depolarized voltages with physiological relevance in neurons, even though maximal Ca2+ current density through ΔF1502 CaV2.1 channels is 60% lower than through wild-type channels. ΔF1502 accelerates activation kinetics and slows deactivation kinetics of CaV2.1 within a wide range of voltage depolarization. ΔF1502 also slowed CaV2.1 inactivation kinetic and shifted the inactivation curve to hyperpolarized potentials (by ~ 28 mV). ΔF1502 effects on CaV2.1 activation and deactivation properties seem to be of high physiological relevance. Thus, ΔF1502 strongly promotes Ca2+ influx in response to either single or trains of action potential-like waveforms of different durations. Our observations support a causative role of gain-of-function CaV2.1 mutations in congenital ataxia, a neurodevelopmental disorder at the severe-most end of CACNA1A-associated phenotypic spectrum.\n",

      "PMID:  20585245\n",
      "Abs: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the present review we discuss the role of botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) in the management of different pain conditions, with evidence-based data on the toxins' efficacy on pain and its mechanisms. RECENT FINDINGS: Experimental in-vitro studies have reported promising results of a novel recombinant chimera of BoNT A and E that inhibits the calcitonin gene-related peptide exocytosis from brainstem sensory neurons. Animal studies in neuropathic pain rat models have reported an analgesic effect of BoNT A given after the neuropathic procedure and a bilateral antinociceptive effect to the unilateral noxious stimuli. There is a growing body of evidence that BoNTs are effective in myofascial pain syndrome, neuropathic pain, and joint pain. The pre-existing evidence that BoNTs are ineffective in migraine or other headache disorders has not yet been challenged. In other pain syndromes, studies published in the last review year have not contributed significantly in either demonstrating or invalidating the research that has so far proved inconclusive. SUMMARY: The role of BoNTs in management of pain is not yet well established. Larger studies in neuropathic pain, joint pain, and myofascial pain syndrome are needed to fully ascertain the role for BoNT therapy in those areas.\n",

      "PMID:  14648337\n",
      "Abs: Mitochondrial disorder is a relatively rare disease during childhood. Previous studies concluded that renal complications in this disease most often occur in patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. We describe a boy with mitochondrial disease who presented with proteinuria while lacking neuromyopathy. Proteinuria was detected at the age of 6 years, including large amounts of low-molecular-weight proteins such as beta(2)- and alpha1-microglobulin. Renal functions were normal. Proximal tubular dysfunction and other renal manifestations were absent. Episodic neurologic problems such as migraine and nervous system diseases including epilepsy, depression, schizophrenia and amytrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were found in the boy's family members. Renal tubular basement membrane atrophy and interstitial fibrosis with mononuclear cell infiltration were observed. Ultrastructural examination showed mitochondria, mainly in the proximal tubules, which varied in size and had disoriented cristae. Mutation analysis using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) extracted from renal tissues demonstrated a A-->G point mutation at nucleotide position 3243 in the tRNA(Leu(UUR)) gene, while there was no mutation found in mtDNA extracted from peripheral leukocytes. Awareness among pediatricians of mitochondrial disorders, detection of low-molecular-weight proteinuria, renal ultrastructural examination and mutation analysis of mtDNA obtained from renal tissues could be important for early diagnosis of this disease.\n",

      "PMID:  29297736\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) can cause migraines, yet it is also a potent vasodilator that protects against hypertension. Given the emerging role of CGRP-targeted antibodies for migraine prevention, an important question is whether the protective actions of CGRP are mediated by vascular or neural CGRP receptors. To address this, we have characterized the cardiovascular phenotype of transgenic nestin/hRAMP1 mice that have selective elevation of a CGRP receptor subunit in the nervous system, human receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (hRAMP1). Nestin/hRAMP1 mice had relatively little hRAMP1 RNA in blood vessels and intravenous injection of CGRP caused a similar blood pressure decrease in transgenic and control mice. At baseline, nestin/hRAMP1 mice exhibited similar mean arterial pressure, heart rate, baroreflex sensitivity, and sympathetic vasomotor tone as control mice. We previously reported that expression of hRAMP1 in all tissues favorably improved autonomic regulation and attenuated hypertension induced by angiotensin II (Ang II). Similarly, in nestin/hRAMP1 mice, hypertension caused by Ang II or phenylephrine was greatly attenuated, and associated autonomic dysregulation and increased sympathetic vasomotor tone were diminished or abolished. We conclude that increased expression of neuronal CGRP receptors is sufficient to induce a protective change in cardiovascular autonomic regulation with implications for migraine therapy.\n",

      "Abs: PRRT2 gene mutations cause paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD), infantile convulsions, hemiplegic migraine, and episodic ataxia. A 21-year-old woman reported an episode of dizziness and ataxic gait occurring after swimming. Brain MRI showed a hyperintense cerebellar lesion on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with decreased apparent diffusion coefficient. The clinical course was favorable. Both clinical and MRI abnormalities regressed. Her brother had presented PKD since adulthood. A C.649dupC PRRT2 truncating mutation was identified in both patients. To our knowledge, this is the first case of an acute cerebellar ataxia associated with heterozygous PRRT2 mutation and transient cerebellar hyperintensity on DWI. Among the clinical and genetic heterogeneities of familial paroxysmal disorders, PRRT2 mutation may be considered in patients with episodic cerebellar ataxia and diffusion restriction on neuroimaging.CI - Copyright © 2018.

      "PMID:  23639391\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an inherited cerebral small vessel disease, clinically characterized by migraine, recurrent transient ischemic attacks or strokes, psychiatric disorders and cognitive decline. Strokes are typically ischemic, while hemorrhagic events have been only sporadically described. However, cerebral microbleeds have been found in 31-69% of CADASIL patients. METHODS: We describe four unrelated CADASIL patients who had hemorrhagic strokes. We also briefly review the literature on intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in CADASIL. RESULTS: Three patients had a thalamo-capsular hemorrhage (age at onset: 54, 67, 77) and one of these had a second hemispheric cerebellar hemorrhage. Another patient experienced an interpeduncular cistern subarachnoid hemorrhage when he was 39. None of these patients was receiving antiplatelets, anticoagulants or statins at the time of hemorrhage; all were hypertensive. NOTCH3 gene analysis revealed mutations on exons 14, 22 (two patients presenting the same mutation), and 24. MRI signs of previous hemorrhages were present in all these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Hemorrhagic stroke can occur in CADASIL similarly to sporadic cerebral small vessel diseases; this finding expands the phenotype of the disease. A diagnosis of CADASIL should probably be considered also in patients with ICH. These data bear potential implications in terms of need of better control of risk factors, particularly hypertension, and raise relevant questions about the use of antiplatelets as prevention measures in CADASIL patients.CI - Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

      "PMID:  9662753\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVES: The focus of this review was on proteins and peptides found in saliva. Of greatest interest were those neuropeptides relevant to nociception and to the pathogenesis of chronic pain syndromes. An additional goal was to develop a standardized protocol to collect saliva for laboratory assessment. METHODS: Data were obtained through discussion with experts at the medical schools in San Antonio and Heidelberg and a Medline literature search involving all relevant studies from 1966 to 1997. The literature search was based on the following key terms: saliva, serotonin, neuropeptide, substance P (SP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and nerve growth factor (NGF). RESULTS: The mean concentration of SP in the saliva of healthy normal controls ranged from 9.6 to 220 pg/mL. Generally, the concentration of SP was approximately three times higher in saliva than in plasma. In a number of painful conditions, particularly tension headache, substantial elevations of salivary SP were found. Mean values for salivary CGRP in healthy controls were approximately 22 pmol/L and were significantly elevated in patients with migraine attacks or cluster headache. There were no data to indicate prior quantitative determination of NGF in human saliva. CONCLUSIONS: After sampling and processing techniques have been standardized, measurement of neuropeptides in human saliva could provide a valuable tool for study of patients with chronic painful disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and even fibromyalgia syndrome.\n",

      "PMID:  11464469\n",
      "Abs: To clarify the characteristics of CADASIL in Japan, we performed clinical and genetic investigations for six patients from 5 Japanese families diagnosed as CADASIL. We identified that the onset of focal neurologic deficits ranged from 38 to 63 years old (mean 49 +/- 9.4 yrs) and the occurrence rates of main neurologic symptoms and signs were 1/6 for migraine, 3/6 for recurrent stroke episodes, 6/6 for dementia, and 4/6 for pseudobulbar palsy. The marked narrowing of retinal arteries were observed in 3/6. The notch 3 mutations were all found in exon 4. Although other several families shared similar phenotype of CADASIL, there were no deposition of granular osmiophilic materials within the basal lamina of smooth muscle cells in the arterioles of biopsied muscle and no mutations in the cording regions of notch 3 gene. We investigated prospectively the incidence of CADASIL and CADASIL-like disease in Kumamoto district from 1999 to 2000. One thousand and thirty four patients with stroke were hospitalized in 6 hospitals which have stroke care unit. Among them, 7 patients fulfilled the criteria that were less than 60 years old, lacunar strokes and/or TIA, presence of a family history, and no risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. One of seven patients was diagnosed as CADASIL by DNA analysis. It was suspected the incidences of CADASIL and CADASIL-like disease were not so rare in Japan.\n",

      "PMID:  16242631\n",
      "Abs: Episodic neurological dysfunction often results from ion channel gene mutations. Despite knowledge of the mutations, the factors that precipitate attacks in channelopathies are not clear. In humans, mutations of the calcium channel gene CACNA1A are associated with attacks of neurological dysfunction in familial hemiplegic migraine and episodic ataxia type-2. In tottering mice, a mutation in the same gene causes attacks resembling paroxysmal dyskinesia. Stress, a trigger associated with human episodic disorders, reliably elicits attacks in tottering mice. Because noradrenergic neurotransmission is critical to the stress response and because noradrenergic hyperinnervation is observed in tottering mice, the role of norepinephrine in stress-induced attacks was investigated. Drugs that act at alpha-adrenergic receptors to block noradrenergic transmission prevented attacks. However, agents that facilitate noradrenergic neurotransmission failed to induce attacks. These results suggest that, while noradrenergic neurotransmission may be necessary for attacks, an increase in norepinephrine is not sufficient to induce attacks.\n",

      "Abs: PURPOSE: Definite diagnosis of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukocencephalopathy (CADASIL) is mostly done by identification of NOTCH3 mutations. We aimed to develop criteria for selecting patients suspected for CADASIL to undergo genetic testing. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: All subjects were Japanese. We recruited CADASIL patients genetically diagnosed up until 2011 (n=37, Group 1) or after 2011 (n=65, Group 2), 67 young stroke patients (≤55 years old), and 53 NOTCH3-negative CADASIL-like patients. The members of Japanese research committee for hereditary cerebral small vessel disease discussed and generated the new criteria to maximize positive rate in Group 1 CADASIL patients, followed by validation of sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: In Group 1 CADASIL patients, the ages at onset excluding migraine were distributed widely (37-74 years old) and bimodal (<55 and >55 years old). Frequencies of an autosomal dominant family history and vascular risk factor(s) were 73 and 65%, respectively. From these findings, the panel considered appropriate cut-off values and weighting for each item. In CADASIL Group 1 versus young stroke controls, the sensitivity and specificity of the new criteria were 97.3% and 80.6%, respectively. However, in CADASIL Group 2 versus NOTCH3-negative controls, the sensitivity and specificity were 96.9% and 7.5%, respectively. Forty mutations of NOTCH3 distributed in exons 2-8, 11, 14, 18, 19, and 21 were identified in this study. Ten mutations were unreported ones. CONCLUSION: We propose the new criteria of high sensitivity, which will help physicians to assess the need for genetic testing.CI - Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

      "Abs: Preclinical Research In this review, we discuss epigenetic-driven methods for treating neurodegenerative disorders associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, focusing on carnitinoid antioxidant-histone deacetylase inhibitors that show an ability to reinvigorate synaptic plasticity and protect against neuromotor decline in vivo. Aging remains a major risk factor in patients who progress to dementia, a clinical syndrome typified by decreased mental capacity, including impairments in memory, language skills, and executive function. Energy metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction are viewed as determinants in the aging process that may afford therapeutic targets for a host of disease conditions, the brain being primary in such thinking. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a core feature in the pathophysiology of both Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases and rare mitochondrial diseases. The potential of new therapies in this area extends to glaucoma and other ophthalmic disorders, migraine, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, post-traumatic stress disorder, systemic exertion intolerance disease, and chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment. An emerging and hopefully more promising approach to addressing these hard-to-treat diseases leverages their sensitivity to activation of master regulators of antioxidant and cytoprotective genes, antioxidant response elements, and mitophagy.

      "PMID:  1436092\n",
      "Abs: Neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, migraine, vasospasm and epilepsy may involve different subtypes of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor. The 1B subtype, which has a unique pharmacology, was first identified in rodent brain. But a similar receptor could not be detected in human brain, suggesting the absence in man of a receptor with equivalent function. Recently a human receptor gene was isolated (designated 5-HT1B receptor, 5-HT1D beta receptor, or S12 receptor) which shares 93% identity of the deduced protein sequence with rodent 5-HT1B receptors. Although this receptor is identical to rodent 5-HT1B receptors in binding to 5-HT, it differs profoundly in binding to many drugs. Here we show that replacement of a single amino acid in the human receptor (threonine at residue 355) with a corresponding asparagine found in rodent 5-HT1B receptors renders the pharmacology of the receptors essentially identical. This demonstrates that the human gene does indeed encode a 1B receptor, which is likely to have the same biological functions as the rodent 5-HT1B receptor. In addition, these findings show that minute sequence differences between homologues of the same receptor from different species can cause large pharmacological variation. Thus, drug-receptor interactions should not be extrapolated from animal to human species without verification.\n",

      "PMID:  30917683\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Cluster headache is the most severe primary headache disorder. A genetic basis has long been suggested by family and twin studies; however, little is understood about the genetic variants that contribute to cluster headache susceptibility. METHODS: We conducted a literature search of the MEDLINE database using the PubMed search engine to identify all human genetic studies for cluster headache. In this article we provide a review of those genetic studies, along with an overview of the pathophysiology of cluster headache and a brief review of migraine genetics, which have both been significant drivers of cluster headache candidate gene selection. RESULTS: The investigation of cluster headache genetic etiology has been dominated by candidate gene studies. Candidate selection has largely been driven by the pathophysiology, such as the striking rhythmic nature of the attacks, which spurred close examination of the circadian rhythm genes CLOCK and HCRTR2. More recently, unbiased genetic approaches such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have yielded new genetic avenues of interest including ADCYAP1R1 and MME. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of candidate genes studied for cluster headache suffer from poor reproducibility. Broader genetic interrogation through larger unbiased GWAS, exome, and whole genome studies may provide more robust candidates, and in turn provide a clearer understanding of the causes of cluster headache.\n",

      "Abs: Recurrent transient ischemic attacks, migraine and dementia represent the principal symptoms of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL). During the course of the disease, about 10% of patients may experience epileptic seizures, mainly related to the presence of an ischemic stroke. We present a 30-year-old woman with new-onset focal epilepsy leading to the diagnosis of CADASIL. The neuropsychological testing revealed no cognitive impairment. Interictal EEG demonstrated spikes and polyspikes with low amplitude over the right occipital region during NREM sleep. MRI showed white-matter hyperintensities on both hemispheres with confluent lesions at the right parieto-occipital junction, with juxtacortical components. Like in multiple sclerosis, we can suppose that this type of white matter lesions, close to the cortex, may be causative of seizures.CI - Copyright © 2011 British Epilepsy Association.

      "Abs: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability and the leading form of the monogenic cause of autism. Fragile X mental retardation type 1 (FMR1) gene premutation is the first single-gene cause of primary ovarian failure (Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency [FXPOI]) and one of the most common causes of ataxia (fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome [FXTAS]), multiple additional phenotypes such as fibromyalgia, hypothyroidism, migraine headaches, sleep disturbances, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, central pain syndrome, neuropathy and neuropsychiatric alterations has been described. Clinical involvement in men and women carrying the FMR1 premutation currently constitutes a real health problem in the society that should be taken into account. It is important to highlight that while in FXS there is a loss-of-function of the FMR1 gene, in premutation associated disorders there is a gain of FMR1 mRNA function. To date, the tremendous progress achieved in the understanding of the pathophysiology of FXS, has led to the development of several targeted therapies aimed at preventing or improving the neurological manifestations of the disease. This review is an update of the diseases associated with the FMR1 gene.CI - © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n",

      "Title: Immunohistochemical localization of calcitonin receptor-like receptor and receptor activity-modifying proteins in the human cerebral vasculature\n",
      "PMID:  11973435\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide and adrenomedullin belong to a structurally related neuropeptide family and are potent vasodilators expressed in the trigeminovascular system. The molecular identity of receptors for these proteins has only recently been elucidated. Central to functional binding of these neuropeptides is the G-protein-coupled receptor, the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR), whose cell surface expression and pharmacology is determined by coexpression of a receptor activity-modifying protein (RAMP). CRLR combined with RAMP binds calcitonin gene-related peptide with high affinity, whereas CRLR coexpression with RAMP2 or -3 confers high-affinity binding of adrenomedullin. The authors investigated the expression of these receptor components in human cerebral vasculature to further characterize neuropeptide receptor content and the potential functions of these receptors. Localization has been carried out using specific antisera raised against immunogenic peptide sequences that were subsequently applied using modern immunohistochemical techniques and confocal microscopy. The results are the first to show the presence of these receptor component proteins in human middle meningeal, middle cerebral, pial, and superficial temporal vessels, and confirm that both calcitonin gene-related peptide and adrenomedullin receptors may arise from the coassembly of RAMPs with CRLR in these vessel types. These novel data advance the understanding of the molecular function of the trigeminovascular system, its potential role in vascular headache disorders such as migraine, and may lead to possible ways in which future synthetic ligands may be applied to manage these disorders.\n",

      "Title: Clinical features and mutation spectrum in Chinese patients with CADASIL: A multicenter retrospective study\n",
      "PMID:  28710804\n",
      "Abs: AIM: To characterize clinical features and mutation spectrum in Chinese patients with CADASIL. METHODS: We collected 261 clinically suspected Chinese CADASIL patients from three hospitals located in different regions of China. Sanger sequencing is performed to screen the exons 2 to 24 of NOTCH3 gene. Clinical and genetic data were retrospectively studied. Haplotype analyses were performed in patients carrying p.Arg544Cys and p.Arg607Cys, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 214 patients were finally genetically diagnosed as CADASIL, with 45 known NOTCH3 mutations and a novel c.1817G>T mutation. We found that patients carrying p.Arg607Cys or p.Arg544Cys mutation located in exon 11 occupied nearly 35% in our mutation spectrum. In retrospectively study of clinical data, we found a higher number of patients having cognitive impairment and a lower number of patients having migraine with aura. Furthermore, we identified that patients carrying mutations in exon 11 seemed to experience a later disease onset (p=6.8×10(-5) ). Additionally, a common haplotype was found in patients from eastern China carrying p.Arg607Cys, and the patients from Fujian carrying p.Arg544Cys shared the same haplotype with patients from Taiwan carrying p.Arg544Cys. CONCLUSIONS: These findings broaden the mutational and clinical spectrum of CADASIL and provide additional evidences for the existence of founder effect in CADASIL patients.CI - © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n",

      "PMID:  29706439\n",
      "Abs: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) due to mutations of the NOTCH3 gene is the most common cause of inherited cerebral small-vessel disease and one of the genetic causes of migraine with aura. The so-called CADASIL scale has been proposed as a clinical screening tool, and a score of 15 or higher seems useful in identifying patients with high probability of carrying NOTCH3 mutations. We studied a novel Greek family with clinical features compatible with CADASIL. Genetic analysis of NOTCH3 in the 2 living patients revealed the R182C mutation. Both patients had low scores (12 and 14) in the CADASIL scale, probably due to their relatively young age (38 and 37 years, respectively) at which cognitive decline and external capsule involvement have not developed yet. Another unusual feature in the second patient was a venous dysplasia in the parietal lobe. Observations presented here add to the notion that the CADASIL scale, although useful, probably needs a revision, taking into account the patient's age at which the score is calculated.CI - Copyright © 2018 National Stroke Association.

      "Abs: INTRODUCTION: Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) is characterized by the familial occurrence of migraine attacks with fully reversible transient hemiplegia. Mutations in three different genes have been identified; CACNA1A (FHM1), ATP1A2 (FHM2) and SCN1A (FHM3). Besides hemiplegia, several other symptoms have been described in FHM 1-3 mutation carriers, including epilepsy and cerebellar symptoms. CASE REPORT: We describe two patients in whom hemiplegic attacks were not the presenting symptom, but in whom an otherwise unexplained head tremor led us to search for FHM mutations. Both patients carried a mutation in the CACNA1A gene. DISCUSSION: CACNA1A mutations can give significant symptoms other than (hemiplegic) migraine as reason for presentation.\n",

      "PMID:  27090750\n",
      "Abs: Recent attempts to analyze human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-induced gene expression changes in astrocytes uncovered a multifunctional oncogene, astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1). Our previous studies revealed that AEG-1 regulates reactive astrocytes proliferation, migration and inflammation, hallmarks of aging and CNS injury. Moreover, the involvement of AEG-1 in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington's disease and migraine, and its induction in the aged brain suggest a plausible role in regulating overall CNS homeostasis and aging. Therefore, it is important to investigate AEG-1 specifically in aging-associated cognitive decline. In this study, we decipher the common mechanistic links in cancer, aging and HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders that likely contribute to AEG-1-based regulation of astrocyte responses and function. Despite AEG-1 incorporation into HIV-1 virions and its induction by HIV-1, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, the specific role(s) of AEG-1 in astrocyte-driven HIV-1 neuropathogenesis are incompletely defined. We propose that AEG-1 plays a central role in a multitude of cellular stress responses involving mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and the nucleolus. It is thus important to further investigate AEG-1-based cellular and molecular regulation in order to successfully develop better therapeutic approaches that target AEG-1 to combat cancer, HIV-1 and aging.CI - Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Title: Are the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 1298 and 677 gene polymorphisms related to optic glioma and hamartoma risk in neurofibromatosis type 1 patients?PG - 152-158AB - The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene plays a key role in carcinogenesis through its effects on DNA synthesis and methylation and also has a significant role in the etiology of many disorders, such as diabetes, migraine, and cardiovascular disease. Neurofibromatoses (NF) are autosomal dominant inherited diseases that can affect tissues such as bone and skin and predispose individuals to tumor development in various parts of the nervous system or body. Optic nerve glioma and brain tumors are common in children with NF, and leukemia and lymphoma incidence is also higher than normal. We therefore aimed to investigate the possible relationship between the MTHFR gene polymorphism and accompanying tumors such as neurofibroma, hamartoma, and optic glioma in children with NF1 found to have the MTHFR 677 and MTHFR 1298 gene polymorphism in this study. We included 55 pediatric patients diagnosed with NF1 between 2005 and 2014 in the study group. The control group included 44 healthy subjects without acute or chronic disease findings.

      "PMID:  21748931\n",
      "Abs: Valproic acid (VPA) has been used for > 30 years in the treatment of epilepsy and is now one of the most frequently prescribed anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) worldwide. Its chronic use has been associated with hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries in women with epilepsy and thus suggests change in normal levels of estrogens--the gonadal steroids in females. We have tested the hypothesis whether AEDs that exert anticonvulsive effects via key molecules of the gamma amino butyric acid (GABAergic) system, have inhibitory effects on the hypothalamo-hypophyseal-gonadal (HPG) axis at the level of hypothalamic gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) synthesis and/or release and thereby affect reproductive health. Three-month old female Wistar rats were given VPA (i.p.) at a dose of 300 mg/Kg once a day for 12 weeks; the control group received an equivalent volume of vehicle. Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and their mRNA expression in the median eminence arcuate region (ME-ARC) of the hypothalamus were upregulated in the VPA treated group. By contrast, polysialyltransferase (PST) mRNA which is the enzyme responsible for the polysialylation of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), a plasticity marker, was found to be downregulated. These results support our hypothesis that VPA disrupts normal neuronal-glial plasticity in the hypothalamus and can thereby cause reproductive neuroendocrine disorders in female patients treated for epilepsy, bipolar disorder or migraine.\n",

      "PMID:  24133137\n",
      "Abs: Neutrophils play a major role in inflammatory responses and immune defense against pathogens. Even though expression of inhibitory receptors has been reported on neutrophils, their role remains poorly defined. Here we show that primary human neutrophils expressed immunoglobulin-like transcript 4 (ILT4) inhibitory receptor and that this expression was induced during differentiation of the myelomonoblast PLB-985 cell line into \"neutrophil-like\" cells. Functional assays indicated that human leukocyte antigen G, the preferred ligand of ILT4, inhibited the phagocytic function of neutrophils. ILT4 engagement also impaired reactive oxygen species production induced through CD32a and both receptors were found colocalized into neutrophil lipid rafts. Moreover, neutrophil degranulation induced through inflammatory stimuli increased ILT4 expression as a result of the rapid translocation of an intracellular pool to the cell surface. Consequently to this ILT4 up-regulation, the human leukocyte antigen G-mediated inhibition of neutrophil phagocytic function was enhanced. Finally, we found that ILT4 up-regulation induced on healthy donor neutrophils following stimulation was impaired in presence of plasma from patients with sepsis. Similarly, ILT4 up-regulation was inhibited in neutrophils from septic patients. Altogether, our results reveal a unique mechanism of regulation of neutrophil functions through ILT4 and its exocytosis that may have implications in inflammatory disorders.\n",

      "PMID:  31781974\n",
      "Abs: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: High altitude headache is a common neurological symptom that is associated with ascent to high altitude. It is classified by the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd Edition (ICHD-3) as a disorder of homeostasis. In this article, we review recent clinical and insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of high altitude and airplane headache. We also report a second case of post-LASIK myopic shift at high altitude exposure secondary hypoxia. Headache attributed to airplane travel is a severe typically unilateral orbital headache that usually improves after landing. This was a relative recent introduction to the ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria. Headache pain with flight travel has long been known and may have been previously considered as a part of barotrauma. Recent studies have helped identify this as a distinct headache disorder. RECENT FINDINGS: Physiologic, hematological, and biochemical biomarkers have been identified in recent high altitude studies. There have been recent advance in identification of molecular mechanisms underlying neurophysiologic changes secondary to hypoxia. Calcitonin gene-related peptide, a potent vasodilator, has been implicated in migraine pathophysiology. Recent epidemiological studies indicate that the prevalence of airplane headache may be more common than we think in the adult as well at the pediatric population. Simulated flight studies have identified potential biomarkers. Although research is limited, there have been advances in both clinical and pathophysiological mechanisms associated with high altitude and airplane headache.\n",

      "PMID:  22858217\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is an enzyme implicated in a number of pathological conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Increased blood levels of MMP-9 were found in cancer, heart disease and migraine. Molecular-genetic studies demonstrated an association of functional polymorphism of MMP-9 gene with predisposition to schizophrenia and bipolar illness. In this first study of serum MMP-9 in psychiatric illness, we estimated it in patients with bipolar mood disorder both during depression or mania as well as during immediate remission after these episodes. METHODS: The study was performed on 54 in-patients with bipolar mood disorder (19 males, 35 females), aged 42±14 years. Thirty were studied during acute episode and immediate remission after depression, and 24 during acute episode and immediate remission after mania. The control group consisted of 29 subjects (15 males, 14 females) aged 40±11 years. Serum MMP-9 was estimated by ELISA. RESULTS: In patients with bipolar illness, a significant correlation of MMP-9 levels was obtained with age. Younger patients with depression (below or equal 45 years of age), both during acute episode and in remission after depression had significantly higher MMP-9 levels compared to those with acute episode and remission after mania and control subjects. LIMITATIONS: Relatively small number of patients, who were receiving different antidepressant, antipsychotic and mood stabilizing drugs that might have influenced MMP-9 levels. CONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of serum MMP-9 during depression in young patients may indicate this phenomenon as a possible biochemical marker for staging of bipolar disorder.CI - Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

      "PMID:  21312166\n",
      "Abs: INTRODUCTION: The term CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) refers to a hereditary systemic microangiopathy caused by mutations of the NOTCH3 gene located on chromosome 19. It typically presents in young people with migraine attacks and recurrent ischemic strokes, leading to a progressive subcortical cognitive decline over several years. AIM: To describe the symptoms of onset and clinical manifestations in 11 CADASIL patients diagnosed by genetic testing or skin biopsy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Detailed physical and neurological examinations, vital signs, electrocardiogram, laboratory investigations (including glucose levels, lipid profile, coagulation studies and homocysteine levels, among others), brain MRI, Mini-Mental Test and Trail Making Test A and B were done. In addition, some patients with complaints related to depressive symptoms or impaired cognition received the Montgomery and Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and a battery of neuropsychological examinations (the Stroop Color and Word Test and the V-ADAS-cog that includes the Maze Test). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our patients presented with a clinical course and a radiological pattern similar to those described previously in the literature. We found a delay in the detection of this pathology and previous diagnostic errors in some patients and their relatives. Multiple sclerosis was the most frequent misdiagnosis. The course of the disease was barely modified by therapeutic interventions introduced to control the progression of the symptoms. Cognitive complaints in patients with advanced stages were common and the executive abilities were found to be impaired in many cases.\n",

      "PMID:  16775382\n",
      "Abs: Intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) is highly regulated in eukaryotic cells. The free [Ca2+]i is approximately four orders of magnitude less than that in the extracellular environment. It is, therefore, an electrochemical gradient favoring Ca2+ entry, and transient cellular activation increasing Ca2+ permeability will lead to a transient increase in [Ca2+]i. These transient rises of [Ca2+]i trigger or regulate diverse intracellular events, including metabolic processes, muscle contraction, secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters, cell differentiation, and gene expression. Hence, changes in [Ca2+]i act as a second messenger system coordinating modifications in the external environment with intracellular processes. Notably, information on the molecular genetics of the membrane channels responsible for the influx of Ca2+ ions has led to the discovery that mutations in these proteins are linked to human disease. Ca2+ channel dysfunction is now known to be the basis for several neurological and muscle disorders such as migraine, ataxia, and periodic paralysis. In contrast to other types of genetic diseases, Ca2+ channelopathies can be studied with precision by electrophysiological methods, and in some cases, the results have been highly rewarding with a biophysical phenotype that correlates with the ultimate clinical phenotype. This review outlines recent advances in genetic, molecular, and pathophysiological aspects of human Ca2+ channelopathies.\n",

      "PMID:  26208839\n",
      "Abs: Ataxia is the predominant clinical manifestation of cerebellar dysfunction. Mutations in the human CACNA1A gene, encoding the pore-forming α1 subunit of CaV2.1 (P/Q-type) calcium channels, underlie several neurological disorders, including Episodic Ataxia type 2 and Familial Hemiplegic Migraine type 1 (FHM1). Several mouse mutants exist that harbor mutations in the orthologous Cacna1a gene. The spontaneous Cacna1a mutants Rolling Nagoya (tg(rol)), Tottering (tg) and Leaner (tg(ln)) mice exhibit behavioral motor phenotypes, including ataxia. Transgenic knock-in (KI) mouse strains with the human FHM1 R192Q and S218L missense mutations have been generated. R192Q KI mice are non-ataxic, whereas S218L KI mice display a complex behavioral phenotype that includes cerebellar ataxia. Given the dependence of γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor subunit functioning on localized calcium currents, and the functional link between GABAergic inhibition and ataxia, we hypothesized that cerebellar GABAA receptor expression is differentially affected in Cacna1a mutants and contributes to the ataxic phenotype. Herein we quantified functional GABAA receptors and pharmacologically dissociated cerebellar GABAA receptors in several Cacna1a mutants. We did not identify differences in the expression of GABAA receptor subunits or in the number of functional GABAA receptors in the non-ataxic R192Q KI strain. In contrast, tg(rol) mice had a ∼15% decrease in the number of functional GABAA receptors, whereas S218L KI mice showed a ∼29% increase. Our data suggest that differential changes in cerebellar GABAA receptor expression profile may contribute to the neurological phenotype of cerebellar ataxia and that targeting GABAA receptors might represent a feasible complementary strategy to treat cerebellar ataxia.CI - Copyright © 2015 IBRO.

      "Abs: The CACNA1A gene encodes a calcium-dependent voltage channel, localized in neuronal cells. Pathogenic variants in this gene are known to lead to a broad clinical spectrum including episodic ataxia type 2, spinocerebellar ataxia type 6, familial hemiplegic migraine, and more recently epileptic encephalopathy. We report a large family revealing a wide variability of neurological manifestations associated with a CACNA1A missense pathogenic variant. The index case had early-onset epileptic encephalopathy with progressive cerebellar atrophy, although his mother and his great-grandmother suffered from paroxystic episodic ataxia. His grandfather and great grand-aunt reported no symptoms, but two of her sons displayed early-onset ataxia with intellectual disability. Two of her little daughters suffered from gait disorders, and also from epilepsy for one of them. All these relatives were carriers of the previously described heterozygous variant in CACNA1A gene. We report here the first family leading to major clinical variability and incomplete penetrance. Our family highlights the difficulties to provide accurate genetic counselling concerning prenatal diagnosis regarding highly variable severity of the clinical presentation.CI - Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical spectrum of benign nocturnal alternating hemiplegia of childhood (BNAHC) including long-term follow-up data of previously published cases and to propose an underlying genetic cause of this disorder. METHODS: We studied the medical data of two novel patients, reviewed the literature on BNAHC, and gathered information of the most recent follow-up of published cases regarding the course of episodes, further development, attempted drugs, ancillary investigations, and sequelae. RESULTS: All patients, i.e. two novel cases and twelve patients identified in the literature (13 boys, 1 girl, age at onset four months to three years), experienced episodes of hemiplegia during nocturnal or daytime sleep heralded by inconsolable crying. Possible triggers included stress and sleep deprivation. Eleven of fourteen patients had a family history of migraine or 'intermittent headache' and two sets of siblings are reported. In one case, exome sequencing revealed a heterozygous 16p11.2 deletion involving 33 genes, including the PRRT2 gene. EEG showed ictal and/or interictal contralateral slowing in four patients. Treatment efficacy was generally disappointing. A complete disappearance of attacks appeared in nearly all cases at most recent follow-up. In a remarkably high number of cases (10/14, 71%), hyperactive behaviour was reported during follow-up. CONCLUSION: We underscore the phenotypic homogeneity including the self-limiting course of BNAHC episodes and suggest the condition be renamed 'benign childhood hemiplegia during sleep' (BCHS). We propose a role for the PRRT2 gene and the resulting neuronal hyperexcitability as one of its possible underpinning mechanisms and discuss the clinical similarities of BCHS with the recognized PRRT2-related disorders.CI - Copyright © 2018 European Paediatric Neurology Society.

      "PMID:  28699403\n",
      "Abs: Background The trigeminal ganglion contains neurons that relay sensations of pain, touch, pressure, and many other somatosensory modalities to the central nervous system. The ganglion is also a reservoir for latent herpes virus 1 infection. To gain a better understanding of molecular factors contributing to migraine and headache, transcriptome analyses were performed on postmortem human trigeminal ganglia. Methods RNA-Seq measurements of gene expression were conducted on small sub-regions of 16 human trigeminal ganglia. The samples were also characterized for transcripts derived from viral and microbial genomes. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) antibodies in blood were measured using the luciferase immunoprecipitation assay. Results Observed molecular heterogeneity could be explained by sampling of anatomically distinct sub-regions of the excised ganglia consistent with neurally-enriched and non-neural, i.e. Schwann cell, enriched subregions. The levels of HSV-1 transcripts detected in trigeminal ganglia correlated with blood levels of HSV-1 antibodies. Multiple migraine susceptibility genes were strongly expressed in neurally-enriched trigeminal samples, while others were expressed in blood vessels. Conclusions These data provide a comprehensive human trigeminal transcriptome and a framework for evaluation of inhomogeneous post-mortem tissues through extensive quality control and refined downstream analyses for RNA-Seq methodologies. Expression profiling of migraine susceptibility genes identified by genetic association appears to emphasize the blood vessel component of the trigeminovascular system. Other genes displayed enriched expression in the trigeminal compared to dorsal root ganglion, and in-depth transcriptomic analysis of the KCNK18 gene underlying familial migraine shows selective neural expression within two specific populations of ganglionic neurons. These data suggest that expression profiling of migraine-associated genes can extend and amplify the underlying neurobiological insights obtained from genetic association studies.\n",

      "PMID:  17236110\n",
      "Abs: Alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC) is a severe brain disorder, mainly characterised by episodes of hemiplegia, progressive mental retardation, and other severe paroxysmal and permanent neurological symptoms. Clinically and genetically, there is some overlap with sporadic (SHM) and familial (FHM) hemiplegic migraine, a severe monogenic subtype of migraine. Although no mutations were detected in the FHM1 CACNA1A and FHM2 ATP1A2 genes in sporadic AHC patients, a mutation was found in the FHM2 ATP1A2 gene in a family with AHC. Recently, a missense mutation was found in the SLC1A3 gene that encodes the glutamate transporter EAAT1, in a patient with alternating hemiplegia, episodic ataxia, seizures, and headache. Because of the remarkable clinical similarities and the potential role of glutamate in AHC, we analysed six sporadic patients with AHC for mutations in the SLC1A3 gene. No mutations were found. The SLC1A3 EAAT1 glutamate transporter gene does not seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of AHC.\n",

      "Title: ADCK3 mutations with epilepsy, stroke-like episodes and ataxia: a POLG mimic?PG - 1188-94LID - 10.1111/ene.13003 [doi]AB - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Defects of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) metabolism cause a variety of disorders ranging from isolated myopathy to multisystem involvement. ADCK3 is one of several genes associated with CoQ10 deficiency that presents with progressive cerebellar ataxia, epilepsy, migraine and psychiatric disorders. Diagnosis is challenging due to the wide clinical spectrum and overlap with other mitochondrial disorders. METHODS: A detailed description of three new patients and one previously reported patient from three Norwegian families with novel and known ADCK3 mutations is provided focusing on the epileptic semiology and response to treatment. Mutations were identified by whole exome sequencing and in two measurement of skeletal muscle CoQ10 was performed. RESULTS: All four patients presented with childhood-onset epilepsy and progressive cerebellar ataxia. Three patients had epilepsia partialis continua and stroke-like episodes affecting the posterior brain. Electroencephalography showed focal epileptic activity in the occipital and temporal lobes. Genetic investigation revealed ADCK3 mutations in all patients including a novel change in exon 15: c.T1732G, p.F578V. There was no apparent genotype-phenotype correlation. CONCLUSION: ADCK3 mutations can cause a combination of progressive ataxia and acute epileptic encephalopathy with stroke-like episodes. The clinical, radiological and electrophysiological features of this disorder mimic the phenotype of polymerase gamma (POLG) related encephalopathy and it is therefore suggested that ADCK3 mutations be considered in the differential diagnosis of mitochondrial encephalopathy with POLG-like features\n",

      "PMID:  27881154\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a monogenic, hereditary, small vessel disease of the brain causing stroke and vascular dementia in adults. CADASIL has previously been shown to be caused by varying mutations in the NOTCH3 gene. The disorder is often misdiagnosed due to its significant clinical heterogeneic manifestation with familial hemiplegic migraine and several ataxia disorders as well as the location of the currently identified causative mutations. The aim of this study was to develop a new, comprehensive and efficient single assay strategy for complete molecular diagnosis of NOTCH3 mutations through the use of a custom next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel for improved routine clinical molecular diagnostic testing. RESULTS: Our custom NGS panel identified nine genetic variants in NOTCH3 (p.D139V, p.C183R, p.R332C, p.Y465C, p.C597W, p.R607H, p.E813E, p.C977G and p.Y1106C). Six mutations were stereotypical CADASIL mutations leading to an odd number of cysteine residues in one of the 34 NOTCH3 gene epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, including three new typical cysteine mutations identified in exon 11 (p.C597W; c.1791C>G); exon 18 (p.C977G; c.2929T>G) and exon 20 (p.Y1106C; c.3317A>G). Interestingly, a novel missense mutation in the CACNA1A gene was also identified in one CADASIL patient. All variants identified (novel and known) were further investigated using in silico bioinformatic analyses and confirmed through Sanger sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: NGS provides an improved and effective methodology for the diagnosis of CADASIL. The NGS approach reduced time and cost for comprehensive genetic diagnosis, placing genetic diagnostic testing within reach of more patients.\n",

      "PMID:  28413959\n",
      "Abs: Tolfenamic acid is one of the conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) commonly used for the treatment of inflammation, migraines and pain. There has been a growing body of experimental evidence that tolfenamic acid possesses anti-cancer activity. However, in order to develop a therapeutic strategy using tolfenamic acid for the treatment of cancer, further research is required to highlight reliable cellular and molecular mechanisms of anti-cancer properties. Tolfenamic acid has been shown to alter the expression of several genes that represent cancer hallmarks including apoptosis, growth arrest, angiogenesis and metastasis. Recently, a couple of research groups including ours reported that tolfenamic acid targets multiple oncogenic or tumor suppressive signaling pathways in various types of cancer models. Here, we highlight multiple molecular targets responsible for the anti-cancer mechanism of tolfenamic acid and the benefits of combinational use of this drug with other anti-cancer drugs.CI - Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.\n",

      "PMID:  20874808\n",
      "Abs: Incidence and rate of cardiovascular disease differ between men and women across the life span. Although hypertension is more prominent in men than women, there is a group of vasomotor disorders [i.e. Raynaud's disease, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes) of menopause and migraine] with a female predominance. Both sex and hormones interact to modulate neuroeffector mechanisms including integrated regulation of the Sry gene and direct effect of sex steroid hormones on synthesis, release and disposition of monoamine neurotransmitters, and distribution and sensitivity of their receptors in brain areas associated with autonomic control. The interaction of the sex chromosomes and steroids also modulates these effector tissues, that is, the heart, vascular smooth muscle and endothelium. Although involvement of central serotonergic centres has been studied in regard to mood disorders such as depression, their contribution to cardiovascular risk is gaining attention. Studies are needed to further evaluate how hormonal treatments and drugs used to modulate adrenergic and serotonergic activity affect progression and risk for cardiovascular disease in men and women.CI - © 2010 Mayo Clinic.

      "Title: Neuroanatomical localization, pharmacological characterization and functions of CGRP, related peptides and their receptors\n",
      "PMID:  9353797\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin generelated peptide (CGRP) is a neuropeptide discovered by a molecular approach over 10 years ago. More recently, islet amyloid polypeptide or amylin, and adrenomedullin were isolated from human insulinoma and pheochromocytoma respectively, and revealed between 25 and 50% sequence homology with CGRP. This review discusses findings on the anatomical distributions of CGRP mRNA, CGRP-like immunoreactivity and receptors in the central nervous system, as well as the potential physiological roles for CGRP. The anatomical distribution and biological activities of amylin and adrenomedullin are also presented. Based upon the differential biological activity of various CGRP analogs, the CGRP receptors have been classified in two major classes, namely the CGRP1 and CGRP2 subtypes. A third subtype has also been proposed (e.g. in the nucleus accumbens) as it does not share the pharmacological properties of the other two classes. The anatomical distribution and the pharmacological characteristics of amylin binding sites in the rat brain are different from those reported for CGRP but share several similarities with the salmon calcitonin receptors. The receptors identified thus far for CGRP and related peptides belong to the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Indeed, modulation of adenylate cyclase activity following receptor activation has been reported for CGRP, amylin and adrenomedullin. Furthermore, the binding affinity of CGRP and related peptides is modulated by nucleotides such as GTP. The cloning of various calcitonin and most recently of CGRP1 and adrenomedullin receptors was reported and revealed structural similarities but also significant differences to other members of the G protein-coupled receptors. They may thus form a new subfamily. The cloning of the amylin receptor(s) as well as of the other putative CGRP receptor subtype(s) are still awaited. Finally, a broad variety of biological activities has been described for CGRP-like peptides. These include vasodilation, nociception, glucose uptake and the stimulation of glycolysis in skeletal muscles. These effects may thus suggest their potential role and therapeutic applications in migraine, subarachnoid haemorrhage, diabetes and pain-related mechanisms, among other disorders.\n",

      "PMID:  17485199\n",
      "Abs: The localization of serotonin-7 (5-HT(7)) receptors and the biological activity of ligands have suggested that 5-HT(7) receptors might be involved in pain, migraine, epilepsy, anxiety, depression, memory, and sleep. In the present study, the potential involvement of 5-HT(7) receptors in epilepsy and other seizure disorders was assessed by comparing the seizures produced by three types of electrical stimulation and three chemical convulsants in 5-HT(7) receptor-deficient (knockout, KO) mice to those seizures observed in wild-type (WT) mice. Thresholds for producing electroshock-induced clonic seizures did not differ between KO versus WT mice. However, thresholds for producing electroshock-induced tonic seizures were significantly lower in KO than in WT mice. Seizures produced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ, a GABA(A) receptor antagonist), N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA, an agonist at NMDA-type glutamate receptors), and cocaine (an inhibitor of monoamine uptake) were also studied. PTZ was more potent in inducing seizures in 5-HT(7) KO mice than in wild-type mice. Likewise, cocaine was more potent in inducing seizures in 5-HT(7) KO than in WT mice; moreover, death resulted from cocaine administration in 5-HT(7) KO mice but not in WT mice. There was a similar trend for NMDA that did not reach statistical significance. The present findings point to the potential for a generalized reduction in seizure threshold with constitutive deletion of the 5-HT(7) receptor gene. Since seizures have not been reported with pharmacological blockade of the receptor, the findings suggest that adaptive changes may play a role in the low seizure thresholds in these mice. In addition, the data suggest that the lower thresholds for seizures produced by diverse mechanisms should be taken into account when interpreting other aspects of the phenotype and behavioral pharmacology of this mouse.\n",

      "PMID:  29912316\n",
      "Abs: Mutations in PRoline-Rich Transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2) underlie a group of paroxysmal disorders including epilepsy, kinesigenic dyskinesia and migraine. Most of the mutations lead to impaired PRRT2 expression and/or function, emphasizing the pathogenic role of the PRRT2 deficiency. In this work, we investigated the phenotype of primary hippocampal neurons obtained from mouse embryos in which the PRRT2 gene was constitutively inactivated. Although PRRT2 is expressed by both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, its deletion decreases the number of excitatory synapses without significantly affecting the number of inhibitory synapses or the nerve terminal ultrastructure. Analysis of synaptic function in primary PRRT2 knockout excitatory neurons by live imaging and electrophysiology showed slowdown of the kinetics of exocytosis, weakened spontaneous and evoked synaptic transmission and markedly increased facilitation. Inhibitory neurons showed strengthening of basal synaptic transmission, accompanied by faster depression. At the network level these complex synaptic effects resulted in a state of heightened spontaneous and evoked activity that was associated with increased excitability of excitatory neurons in both PRRT2 knockout primary cultures and acute hippocampal slices. The data indicate the existence of network instability/hyperexcitability as the possible basis of the paroxysmal phenotypes associated with PRRT2 mutations.CI - © The Author(s) 2018.

      "PMID:  29167286\n",
      "Abs: Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by recurrent attacks of dyskinetic movements without alteration of consciousness that are often triggered by the initiation of voluntary movements. Whole-exome sequencing has revealed a cluster of pathogenic variants in PRRT2 (proline-rich transmembrane protein), a gene with a function in synaptic regulation that remains poorly understood. Here, we report the discovery of a novel PRRT2 pathogenic variant inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern in a family with PKD and benign familial infantile seizures (BFIS). After targeted Sanger sequencing did not identify the presence of previously described PRRT2 pathogenic variants, we carried out whole-exome sequencing in the proband and her affected paternal grandfather. This led to the discovery of a novel PRRT2 variant, NM_001256442:exon3:c.C959T/NP_660282.2:p.A320V, altering an evolutionarily conserved alanine at the amino acid position 320 located in the M2 transmembrane region. Sanger sequencing further confirmed the presence of this variant in four affected family members (paternal grandfather, father, brother, and proband) and its absence in two unaffected ones (paternal grandmother and mother). This newly found variant further reinforces the importance of PRRT2 in PKD, BFIS, and possibly other movement disorders. Future functional studies using animal models and human pluripotent stem cell models will provide new insights into the role of PRRT2 and the significance of this variant in regulating neural development and/or function.CI - © 2018 Lu et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.\n",

      "PMID:  23890838\n",
      "Abs: Glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1DS) is the result of impaired glucose transport into the brain. The \"classic\" GLUT1DS patient presents with infantile seizures (resistant to traditional seizure medications), developmental delay, acquired microcephaly, hypotonia, spasticity, and a complex movement disorder consisting of ataxia and dystonia. However, over the years, other clinical manifestations have been described, such as paroxysmal exertion-induced dystonia with or without seizures, choreoathetosis, alternating hemiplegia, and other paroxysmal events, such as intermittent ataxia, dystonia, and migraine. At the current state of the art in understanding of GLUT1DS, classifying the disease phenotype as \"classical\" or \"non-classical\" seems to be of limited clinical utility. It seems more appropriate to think in terms of a broad clinical spectrum in which we can observe intellectual impairment, acquired microcephaly, epilepsy, and movement disorders characterized by different clinical manifestations and degrees of severity. Lumbar puncture, a simple investigation, should be considered the first diagnostic step that, moreover, is feasible worldwide. Thereafter, mutational analysis of the solute carrier family 2 (facilitated glucose transporter) member 1 (SLC2A1) gene should be performed in patients with highly suggestive clinical findings and low cerebrospinal fluid glucose (<50mg/dl or ratio <0.60). Early diagnosis is critical because it allows prompt initiation of treatment with a ketogenic diet (KD). Childhood is the critical period for treatment of GLUT1DS: early diagnosis is crucial for an effective etiological therapy. KD treatment can be useful in adulthood too. Compliance has been found to be much better in GLUT1DS than in the other conditions for which KD treatment is indicated.CI - Copyright © 2013 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

      "Abs: AIM: Benign paroxysmal torticollis (BPT), benign paroxysmal vertigo (BPV), and benign tonic upward gaze (BTU) are characterized by transient and recurrent episodes of neurological manifestations. The purpose of this study was to analyse the clinical relationships between these syndromes, associated comorbidities, and genetic bases. METHOD: In this cross-sectional study, clinical data of patients with BPT, BPV, or BTU were collected with a focus on developmental achievements, learning abilities, and rehabilitation. Neuropsychological assessment and genetic testing were performed. RESULTS: Fifty patients (median age at inclusion 6y) were enrolled. Psychomotor delay, abnormal neurological examination, and low or borderline IQ were found in 19%, 32%, and 26% of the patients respectively. Cognitive dysfunction was present in 27% of the patients. CACNA1A gene mutation was identified in eight families, and KCNA1 and FGF14 mutation in one family respectively. The identification of a CACNA1A mutation was significantly associated with BTU (p=0.03) and with cognitive dysfunction (p=0.01). Patients with BPV were less likely to have cognitive dysfunction. INTERPRETATION: Children with BPT, BPV, or BTU are at high risk of impaired psychomotor and cognitive development. These syndromes should not be regarded as benign and should be considered as part of the spectrum of a neurodevelopmental disorder. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS OK: Patients with benign paroxysmal torticollis (BPT), benign paroxysmal vertigo (BPV), and benign tonic upward gaze (BTU) have an increased risk of psychomotor delay. These patients also have an increased risk of abnormal neurological examination and cognitive dysfunction. Gene mutations, especially in CACNA1A, were identified in 21% of the families. BPT, BTU, and BPV should not be regarded as benign. BPT, BTU, and BPV should be considered as part of the spectrum of a neurodevelopmental disorder.CI - © 2018 Mac Keith Press.\n",

      "PMID:  20691201\n",
      "Abs: In the last decade, there was the seminal discovery of melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) as a new class of photoreceptors that subserve the photoentrainment of circadian rhythms and other non-image forming functions of the eye. Since then, there has been a growing research interest on these cells, mainly focused on animal models. Only recently, a few studies have started to address the relevance of the mRGC system in humans and related diseases. We recently discovered that mRGCs resist neurodegeneration in two inherited mitochondrial disorders that cause blindness, i.e. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy and dominant optic atrophy. The mechanism leading to mRGCs sparing in these blinding disorders, characterized by extensive and selective loss of RGCs, is currently unknown and under investigation. Other studies reported on mRGCs in glaucoma, on genetic variation of the melanopsin gene (OPN4) in seasonal affective disorder and on the role of mRGCs in migraineous photophobia. Our own data and studies from others have shown a significant reduction of mRGCs with aging. We anticipate that these studies will lead to many other investigations addressing the role of mRGCs and circadian photoreception in the pathogenesis of circadian and sleep abnormalities in neurodegenerative disorders.CI - Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

      "PMID:  15963503\n",
      "Abs: Neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) are involved in neuropeptide degradation and may modulate neurogenic inflammation. We therefore explored the effect of specific blockers of NEP and ACE on the intensity of neurogenic inflammation. We investigated eight subjects on three occasions. Two pairs of microdialysis fibers equipped with intraluminal wires were inserted intracutaneously into the volar forearms and electrical stimuli were delivered via the intraluminal electrodes. The microdialysis fibers were perfused either with normal saline, phosphoramidon (NEP inhibitor), or captopril (ACE inhibitor). CGRP release was assessed in the microdialysis eluate via a specific EIA and by evaluating the extent and intensity of the neurogenic flare via a laser Doppler imager. The area of hyperalgesia and allodynia was assessed during electrical stimulation. Inhibition of NEP with phosphoramidon increased flare intensity (P < 0.002) and size (P < 0.01), while blocking ACE had no effect on neurogenic vasodilation. CGRP release could be measured in microdialysis samples after phosphoramidon perfusion only (P < 0.03), not in samples with captopril or saline perfusion. No effect on the areas of hyperalgesia and allodynia could be detected. Our findings suggest that NEP but not ACE is most important for CGRP degradation in human skin. This may be of particular importance for the understanding of pain disorders like migraine or complex regional pain syndrome.\n",

      "PMID:  18769544\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Cerebral malaria (CM) is a syndrome characterized by neurological signs, seizures and coma. Despite the fact that CM presents similarities with cerebral stroke, few studies have focused on new supportive therapies for the disease. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy has been successfully used in patients with numerous brain disorders such as stroke, migraine and atherosclerosis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: C57BL/6 mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) were exposed to daily doses of HBO (100% O(2), 3.0 ATA, 1-2 h per day) in conditions well-tolerated by humans and animals, before or after parasite establishment. Cumulative survival analyses demonstrated that HBO therapy protected 50% of PbA-infected mice and delayed CM-specific neurological signs when administrated after patent parasitemia. Pressurized oxygen therapy reduced peripheral parasitemia, expression of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-10 mRNA levels and percentage of gammadelta and alphabeta CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes sequestered in mice brains, thus resulting in a reduction of blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and hypothermia. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The data presented here is the first indication that HBO treatment could be used as supportive therapy, perhaps in association with neuroprotective drugs, to prevent CM clinical outcomes, including death.\n",

      "PMID:  16618267\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the biallelic -231 G>A polymorphism of the endothelin type A receptor (EDNRA) gene, previously shown to be a marker of increased risk for developing migraine, has a role in the susceptibility to primary pediatric headache. BACKGROUND: Several studies suggest that endothelin has a role in migraine. A recent association study has shown that the biallelic -231 G>A polymorphism of the EDNRA gene is associated to migraine in an elderly population. METHODS: A total of 126 consecutive unrelated pediatric patients affected by primary headache, classified according to the International Headache Society criteria in migraine (migraine with aura, n = 3; migraine without aura, n = 80), and tension-type headache (episodic tension-type headache, n = 36; chronic tension-type headache, n = 7) patients, were recruited to the study. Sixty-seven healthy blood donors were used as a control group. Genomic DNA was extracted from buccal swabs or blood samples and analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) for the above-mentioned polymorphism. Allele and genotype frequencies for primary headache patients were analyzed in comparison with the control group. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the distribution of the EDNRA -231 G>A polymorphic variant when considering both genotype (migraine chi2 = 2.78, P = .25; tension-type headache chi2 = 3.58, P = .17) and allelic frequencies (migraine chi2 = 1.48, P = .22; tension-type headache chi2 = 0.39, P = .56). Furthermore, no significant genotype-related difference was found in relation to clinical features, such as age at onset, frequency, and length of the attacks. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the -231 G>A polymorphism in the EDNRA gene is neither associated with primary juvenile headache nor significantly correlated with main clinical features characteristic of the headache pathology in pediatric settings.\n",

      "PMID:  11179022\n",
      "Abs: Familial hemiplegic migraine, episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2), and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 are allelic disorders of the CACNA1A gene (coding for the alpha(1A) subunit of P/Q calcium channels), usually associated with different types of mutations (missense, protein truncating, and expansion, respectively). However, the finding of expansion and missense mutations in patients with EA2 has blurred this genotype-phenotype correlation. We report the first functional analysis of a new missense mutation, associated with an EA2 phenotype-that is, T-->C transition of nt 4747 in exon 28, predicted to change a highly conserved phenylalanine residue to a serine at codon 1491, located in the putative transmembrane segment S6 of domain III. Patch-clamp recording in HEK 293 cells, coexpressing the mutagenized human alpha(1A-2) subunit, together with human beta(4) and alpha(2)delta subunits, showed that channel activity was completely abolished, although the mutated protein is expressed in the cell. These results indicate that a complete loss of P/Q channel function is the mechanism underlying EA2, whether due to truncating or to missense mutations.\n",

      "Abs: The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, skin extensibility, and tissue fragility. This communication briefly reports upon the neurological manifestations that arise including the weakness of the ligaments of the craniocervical junction and spine, early disc degeneration, and the weakness of the epineurium and perineurium surrounding peripheral nerves. Entrapment, deformation, and biophysical deformative stresses exerted upon the nervous system may alter gene expression, neuronal function and phenotypic expression. This report also discusses increased prevalence of migraine, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, Tarlov cysts, tethered cord syndrome, and dystonia, where associations with EDS have been anecdotally reported, but where epidemiological evidence is not yet available. Chiari Malformation Type I (CMI) has been reported to be a comorbid condition to EDS, and may be complicated by craniocervical instability or basilar invagination. Motor delay, headache, and quadriparesis have been attributed to ligamentous laxity and instability at the atlanto-occipital and atlantoaxial joints, which may complicate all forms of EDS. Discopathy and early degenerative spondylotic disease manifest by spinal segmental instability and kyphosis, rendering EDS patients prone to mechanical pain, and myelopathy. Musculoskeletal pain starts early, is chronic and debilitating, and the neuromuscular disease of EDS manifests symptomatically with weakness, myalgia, easy fatigability, limited walking, reduction of vibration sense, and mild impairment of mobility and daily activities. Consensus criteria and clinical practice guidelines, based upon stronger epidemiological and pathophysiological evidence, are needed to refine diagnosis and treatment of the various neurological and spinal manifestations of EDS. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.CI - © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",

      "Title: A prospective study of headache and neuropeptides in patients with pituitary adenomas\n",
      "PMID:  30897942\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical criteria for headache associated with pituitary adenoma (HaPA) in the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) 3rd edition version criteria and further determine whether elevations of plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide 1-38 (PACAP1-38) concentration contribute to HaPA. METHODS: Demographic and clinical features of consecutive patients with pituitary adenoma were recorded. Plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide and PACAP1-38 concentrations in pituitary adenoma patients within 72 h pre- and post-operation were measured. Primary outcome for HaPA patients were 50% reduction of moderate-to-severe headache days at 3 months after discharge. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients with pituitary adenoma were recruited, 33 (52.4%) of whom had headache. The patients who had HaPA presented with migraine-like (32.9%), tension-type-like (12.1%), and stabbing headache (9.1%). Non-functional adenoma was present in the majority of cases (82.5%). Surgical resection improved headache in 83.3% of cases at 3 month follow-up. Pre- and post-operative calcitonin gene-related peptide and PACAP1-38 levels were significantly higher in patients with headache than in those without headache (p < 0.05). Plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide and PACAP1-38 levels at 72 h post-operation were lower at 72 h after operation in patients who had greater improvement in headache compared with those who had little improvement, while plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide and PACAP1-38 levels were similar between these two groups preoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Most pituitary adenoma patients have non-functional adenoma, and half of this group have HaPA, indicating that the ICHD-3 criteria for HaPA with the emphasis on secretion status need further modifications. Lower plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide and PACAP1-38 concentrations at 72 h after operation may predict a better outcome in patients with HaPA.\n",

      "PMID:  15694192\n",
      "Abs: The phenotype and genotype of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy and subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) in Caucasians have been well characterized, but CADASIL is less recognized in Asian populations. Here we investigated the first known Taiwanese family affected by CADASIL and identified an uncommon NOTCH3 mutation. The family had clinical manifestations in affected members including recurrent strokes, early dementia, and depression, but not migraine. A skin biopsy in the proband patient showed characteristic pathological findings of CADASIL on electron microscopy. Afterward, genetic analysis found an Arg332Cys mutation at exon 6 of NOTCH3. Neuropsychological evaluation showed vascular dementia in two of four affected people. Head MRI showed multiple infarcts in bilateral basal ganglia, thalami, periventricular white matter, external capsules, and brainstem, but involvement of the anterior temporal pole was found only in two people with milder symptoms. To our knowledge, the Arg332Cys NOTCH3 mutation at exon 6, which was identified in the studied family, has not been reported in Asian populations. Our findings emphasize the importance of genetic analysis of NOTCH3 for Asians with a phenotype typical of CADASIL.\n",

      "Title: Ca2+ channels as targets of neurological disease: Lambert-Eaton Syndrome and other Ca2+ channelopathies\n",
      "PMID:  15000529\n",
      "Abs: In the nervous system, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels regulate numerous processes critical to neuronal function including secretion of neurotransmitters, initiation of action potentials in dendritic regions of some neurons, growth cone elongation, and gene expression. Because of the critical role which Ca2+ channels play in signaling processes within the nervous system, disruption of their function will lead to profound disturbances in neuronal function. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are the targets of several relatively rare neurological or neuromuscular diseases resulting from spontaneously-occurring mutations in genes encoding for parts of the channel proteins, or from autoimmune attack on the channel protein responses. Mutations in CACNAIA, which encodes for the alpha1A subunit of P/Q-type Ca2+ channels, lead to symptoms seen in familial hemiplegic migraine, episodic ataxia type 2, and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6. Conversely, autoimmune attack on Ca2+ channels at motor axon terminals causes peripheral cholinergic nerve dysfunction observed in Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS), the best studied of the disorders targeting voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. LEMS is characterized by decreased evoked quantal release of acetylcholine (ACh) and disruption of the presynaptic active zones, the sites at which ACh is thought to be released. LEMS is generally believed to be due to circulating antibodies directed specifically at the Ca2+ channels located at or near the active zone of motor nerve terminals (P/Q-type) and hence involved in the release of ACh. However, other presynaptic proteins have also been postulated to be targets of the autoantibodies. LEMS has a high degree of coincidence (approximately 60%) with small cell lung cancer; the remaining 40% of patients with LEMS have no detectable tumor. Diagnosis of LEMS relies on characteristic patterns of electromyographic changes; these changes are observable at neuromuscular junctions of muscle biopsies from patients with LEMS. In the majority of LEMS patients, those having detectable tumor, the disease is thought to occur as a result of immune response directed initially against voltage-gated Ca2+ channels found on the lung tumor cells. In these patients, effective treatment of the underlying tumor generally causes marked improvement of the symptoms of LEMS as well. Animal models of LEMS can be generated by chronic administration of plasma, serum or immunoglobulin G to mice. These models have helped dramatically in our understanding of the pathogenesis of LEMS. This \"passive transfer\" model mimics the electrophysiological and ultrastructural findings seen in muscle biopsies of patients with LEMS. In this model, we have shown that the reduction in amplitude of Ca2+ currents through P/Q-type channels is followed by \"unmasking\" of an L-type Ca2+ current not normally found at the motor nerve terminal which participates in release of ACh from terminals of mice treated with plasma from patients with LEMS. It is unclear what mechanisms underlie the development of this novel L-type Ca2+ current involved in release of ACh at motor nerve terminals during passive transfer of LEMS.\n",

      "PMID:  12235833\n",
      "Abs: In Western communities, 15 to 20% of the general population experiences migraine headaches. In Japan, 3 to 9% of the population experience migraine headaches. Quality of life in headache patients is impaired. The International Headache Society (IHS) published the new headache classification in 1988. Chronic daily headache (CDH) is a common problem in headache clinics. Recently, the problems in classifying CDH have been discussed. CDH is not easily classified within the IHS criteria. For migraine attacks, triptans are effective. The genetic analysis in migraine is progressing. Point mutations in the P/Q-type Ca2+ channel alpha 1 subunit gene in familial hemiplegic migraine and in Notch 3 gene in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), have been identified. Although CADASIL patients in Europe often show migraine headache, migraine attacks are less common in Japanese CADASIL patients.\n",

      "PMID:  22000314\n",
      "Abs: Mutations in the CACNA1A gene were described in familial hemiplegic migraine, episodic ataxia type 2, and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6. Familial hemiplegic migraine and episodic ataxia type 2 are caused by point mutations in the CACNA1A gene, and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 develops as a result of a CAG triple expansion in exon 1 of the gene. Phenotypic variability and clinical overlap are well recognized. We describe a 3-year-old child with clinical and radiologic signs of early-onset cerebellar atrophy. The family history was significant for migraine, and in some members of the family, a diagnosis of hemiplegic migraine was established. The combination of cerebellar atrophy in our patient and the family history suggested involvement of the CACNA1A gene. The sequence analysis of genomic DNA from the proband identified heterozygosity for a mutation (Thr666Met) in the CACNA1A gene. Subsequently, his father, who was mildly affected, and two other relatives were demonstrated to carry the same mutation. Therefore, CACNA1A gene mutations should be considered in the differential diagnosis of congenital cerebellar atrophy.CI - Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n",

      "PMID:  18451999\n",
      "Abs: Paroxysmal dyskinesias are episodic movement disorders that can be inherited or are sporadic in nature. The pathophysiology underlying these disorders remains largely unknown but may involve disrupted ion homeostasis due to defects in cell-surface channels or nutrient transporters. In this study, we describe a family with paroxysmal exertion-induced dyskinesia (PED) over 3 generations. Their PED was accompanied by epilepsy, mild developmental delay, reduced CSF glucose levels, hemolytic anemia with echinocytosis, and altered erythrocyte ion concentrations. Using a candidate gene approach, we identified a causative deletion of 4 highly conserved amino acids (Q282_S285del) in the pore region of the glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). Functional studies in Xenopus oocytes and human erythrocytes revealed that this mutation decreased glucose transport and caused a cation leak that alters intracellular concentrations of sodium, potassium, and calcium. We screened 4 additional families, in which PED is combined with epilepsy, developmental delay, or migraine, but not with hemolysis or echinocytosis, and identified 2 additional GLUT1 mutations (A275T, G314S) that decreased glucose transport but did not affect cation permeability. Combining these data with brain imaging studies, we propose that the dyskinesias result from an exertion-induced energy deficit that may cause episodic dysfunction of the basal ganglia, and that the hemolysis with echinocytosis may result from alterations in intracellular electrolytes caused by a cation leak through mutant GLUT1.\n",

      "PMID:  26316307\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are now an important part of the treatment armamentarium for a wide range of conditions including cancer, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases of the joint and bowel, transplant rejection, and multiple sclerosis. Significant progress over the last 30 years in the development of therapeutic mAbs has resulted in improved efficacy and safety. Monoclonal antibodies approved for the treatment of neurological illnesses so far are limited to use in multiple sclerosis. Several therapeutic mAbs have completed phase 2 clinical trials for migraine prevention, and there are phase 3 trials underway for migraine prophylaxis and for cluster headache at the time of this writing. AIM: The purpose of this review is to discuss the characteristics of mAbs, including their mechanism of action and safety profile, and briefly describe the mAbs being evaluated for the prevention of migraine and cluster headaches. SUMMARY: Monoclonal antibodies have several features that distinguish them from small molecules, including very high selectivity, relatively long half-life that generally allows for once or twice monthly dosing, and significantly reduced potential for drug-drug interactions or other nontarget related toxicities. The clinical development of mAbs that target calcitonin gene-related peptide and its receptor is underway and will evaluate this promising new drug class for the prevention of migraine and cluster headache.CI - © 2015 American Headache Society.\n",

      "PMID:  23065481\n",
      "Abs: Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias are highly disabling primary headache disorders, characterized by severe unilateral head pain and associated ipsilateral cranial autonomic features. There is limited understanding of their pathophysiology and how and where treatments act to reduce symptoms; this is significantly hindered by a lack of animal models. We have developed the first animal model to explore trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, using stimulation within the brainstem, at the level of the superior salivatory nucleus, to activate the trigeminal autonomic reflex arc. Using electrophysiological recording of neurons of the trigeminocervical complex and laser Doppler blood flow changes around the ipsilateral lacrimal duct, superior salivatory nucleus stimulation exhibited both neuronal trigeminovascular and cranial autonomic manifestations. These responses were specifically inhibited by the autonomic ganglion blocker hexamethonium bromide. These data demonstrate that brainstem activation may be the driver of both sensory and autonomic symptoms in these disorders, and part of this activation may be via the parasympathetic outflow to the cranial vasculature. Additionally, both sensory and autonomic manifestations were significantly inhibited by highly effective treatments for trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, such as oxygen, indomethacin and triptans, and some part of their therapeutic action appears to be specifically on the parasympathetic outflow to the cranial vasculature. Treatments more used to migraine, such as naproxen and a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor inhibitor, olcegepant, were less effective in this model. This is the first model to represent the phenotype of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias and their response to therapies, and indicates the parasympathetic pathway may be uniquely involved in their pathophysiology and targeted to relieve symptoms.\n",

      "PMID:  30003352\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) is a key neuropeptide involved in the activation of the trigeminovascular system and it is likely related to migraine chronification. Here, we investigated the role of CGRP in an animal model that mimics the chronic migraine condition via repeated and intermittent nitroglycerin (NTG) administration. We also evaluated the modulatory effect of topiramate on this experimental paradigm. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with NTG (5 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle, every 2 days over a 9-day period (5 total injections). A group of animals was injected with topiramate (30 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline every day for 9 days. Twenty-four hours after the last administration of NTG or vehicle, animals underwent tail flick test and orofacial Von Frey test. Rats were subsequently sacrificed to evaluate c-Fos and CGRP gene expression in medulla-pons region, cervical spinal cord and trigeminal ganglia. RESULTS: NTG administration induced spinal hyperalgesia and orofacial allodynia, together with a significant increase in the expression of CGRP and c-Fos genes in trigeminal ganglia and central areas. Topiramate treatment prevented NTG-induced changes by reversing NTG-induced hyperalgesia and allodynia, and inhibiting CGRP and c-Fos gene expression in all areas evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: These findings point to the role of CGRP in the processes underlying migraine chronification and suggest a possible interaction with gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) and glutamate transmission to induce/maintain central sensitization and to contribute to the dysregulation of descending pain system involved in chronic migraine.\n",

      "Title: Extracts from Dendropanax morbifera Leaves Have Modulatory Effects on Neuroinflammation in Microglia\n",
      "PMID:  26916918\n",
      "Abs: Dendropanax morbifera (D. morbifera), a species endemic to Korea, is largely distributed throughout the southern part of the country. Its leaves, stems, roots, and seeds have been used as a form of alternative medicine for various diseases and neurological disorders including paralysis, stroke, and migraine. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the remedial effects of D. morbifera remain largely unknown. In this paper, extracts from D. morbifera leaves were prepared using ethyl acetate as a solvent (abbreviated as DMLE). The modulatory effects of DMLE on neuroinflammation were studied in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 murine microglial cell line. Production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-[Formula: see text]B), and different M1/M2 activation states of microglia were examined. DMLE treatment suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-[Formula: see text] (TNF-[Formula: see text]), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and nitric oxide (NO) in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells. DMLE treatment also attenuated the activation of MAPKs and NF-[Formula: see text]B. In a novel discovery, we found that DMLE up-regulated the marker genes representing an alternative, anti-inflammatory M2 polarization, while suppressing the expression of the classical, pro-inflammatory M1 activation state genes. Here, we uncovered the cellular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of D. morbifera against neuroinflammation using BV2 microglia cells. These results strongly suggest that DMLE was able to counter the effects of LPS on BV2 cells via control of microglia polarization states. Additionally, study results indicated that DMLE may have therapeutic potential as a neuroinflammation-suppressing treatment for neurodegenerative diseases.\n",

      "PMID:  30742846\n",
      "Abs: Orexins, alternatively called hypocretins, are neuropeptides with crucial role in maintaining wakefulness. The orexin system is thought to mediate a coordinated defense response but thus far investigated from the flight, but never fight, response perspective. An HCRTR1 gene variant (rs2271933 G > A) leading to amino acid substitution (Ile408Val) has been associated with migraine and mood disorders. We genotyped, and assessed aggressive behaviour in both birth cohorts (n = 655 and 583) of the Estonian Children Personality Behaviour and Health Study (ECPBHS). Measures of aggressiveness were collected at age 25 or 33 and data on stressful life events (SLE-s) at age 15. Violations of traffic law were monitored in the samples of the Estonian Psychobiological Study of Traffic Behaviour. In both birth cohorts of the ECPBHS, the HCRTR1 the A/A homozygotes reported higher aggression in both Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire and the Life History of Aggression Interview. With either measure of aggressiveness, the HCRTR1 genotype effect was dependent on experience of SLE, the highest level of aggressiveness increase by environment being found in female A/A homozygotes. The HCRTR1 A/A homozygotes scored higher in the ANGER facet of the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scale, while such an effect on FEAR was found only in females. Male HCRTR1 A/A homozygotes were more likely to relapse into drunk driving of a passenger car, and in two independent samples the A-allele carriers were causing traffic accidents more often. Conclusively, self-report, interview, and traffic record data converge indicating that the HCRTR1 Ile408Val genotype is associated with aggressiveness and breach of law.

      "PMID:  25896802\n",
      "Abs: Cortical spreading depression (SD) is a transient propagating neuronal excitation followed by depression, which is generally accepted as the underlying cause of migraine. The inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor activation not only reduces cortical SD frequency and propagation, but also relieves migraine headache. This study aims to determine the role of major α subtypes of GABAA receptor in mediating SD genesis and propagation using an efficient in vitro chick retinal model. We firstly demonstrated that abundant α2, and to a lesser extent, α5 of GABAA receptor expression in the chick retina, enabled the tissue useful for studying GABAA receptor pharmacology and SD. Marked suppression of SD by SL651498 and TPA023 was observed at 10 μmol L(-1) and 50 μmol L(-1), respectively, suggesting a critical role of GABAA receptor α subtypes, in particular α2, in modulating retinal SD elicitation and propagation. The negative data on NS11394 at 3 μmol L(-1) on SD and the little positive selectivity of TPA023 for α5 did not support that α5 subtype is involved in SD genesis and propagation. Our data provide strong evidence that α2, but not α5 is involved in the early stage of migraine, indicating that α2 subtype is a possible drug target related to migraine with aura.CI - Copyright © 2015 IBRO.

      "PMID:  28856910\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Calcitonin gene-related peptide and its receptor, consisting of receptor activity-modifying protein 1 and calcitonin receptor-like receptor, are of considerable interest because of the role they play in migraine and recently developed migraine therapies. METHODS: To better understand the function of this neuropeptide, we used immunohistochemistry to determine a detailed distribution of calcitonin gene-related peptide, receptor activity-modifying protein 1 and calcitonin receptor-like receptor in the rat brain in a region of 0.5-1.5 mm lateral to the midline. We found calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactivity in most of the neurons of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, thalamic nuclei, hypothalamic nuclei and brainstem nuclei. In contrast, receptor activity-modifying protein 1 and calcitonin receptor-like receptor immunoreactivity were found almost exclusively in the neuronal processes in the investigated regions. CONCLUSION: Overall, the degree of expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide and calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor components in the central nervous system is astonishingly complex and suggestive of many different brain functions, including a possible role in migraine. However, currently, the presence of calcitonin gene-related peptide and the nature of its receptors throughout the brain is an enigma yet to be solved.\n",

      "PMID:  28116293\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a 37-amino-acid neuropeptide belonging to the calcitonin gene peptide superfamily. CGRP is a potent vasodilator with potential therapeutic usefulness for treating vascular-related disease. This peptide is primarily located on C- and Aδ-fibers, which have extensive perivascular presence and a dual sensory-efferent function. Although CGRP has two major isoforms (α-CGRP and β-CGRP), the α-CGRP is the isoform related to vascular actions. Release of CGRP from afferent perivascular nerve terminals has been shown to result in vasodilatation, an effect mediated by at least one receptor (the CGRP receptor). This receptor is an atypical G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) composed of three functional proteins: (i) the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR; a seven-transmembrane protein), (ii) the activity-modifying protein type 1 (RAMP1), and (iii) a receptor component protein (RCP). Although under physiological conditions, CGRP seems not to play an important role in vascular tone regulation, this peptide has been strongly related as a key player in migraine and other vascular-related disorders (e.g., hypertension and preeclampsia). The present review aims at providing an overview on the role of sensory fibers and CGRP release on the modulation of vascular tone.\n",

      "PMID:  16495758\n",
      "Abs: Flunarizine has been widely used for the management of a variety of disorders such as peripheral vascular diseases, migraine, and epilepsy. The majority of its beneficial effects have been attributed to its ability to inhibit voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in the low micromolar range, albeit non-selectively, as flunarizine has been shown to inhibit a variety of ion channels. We examined the effects of flunarizine on potassium currents through cardiac channels encoded by the human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) stably expressed in CHO cells. In this study, we have characterized the effect of flunarizine on biophysical properties of hERG potassium currents with standard whole-cell voltage-clamp techniques. Notably, flunarizine is a highly potent inhibitor of hERG current with an IC50 value of 5.7 nM. The effect of flunarizine on hERG potassium current is concentration and time dependent, and displays voltage dependence over the voltage range between -40 and 0 mV. At concentrations near or above the IC50, flunarizine causes a negative shift in the voltage dependence of hERG current activation and accelerates tail current deactivation. Flunarizine preferentially blocks the activated state of the channel and displays weak frequency dependence of inhibition. Flunarizine also inhibits KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel current with an IC50 of 0.76 microM.\n",

      "PMID:  26891860\n",
      "Abs: Interleukin-1β is one of the main mediators in the cross-talk between the immune system and the central nervous system. Higher interleukin-1β levels are found in mood spectrum disorders, and the stress-induced expression rate of the interleukin-1β gene (IL1B) is altered by polymorphisms in the region. Therefore we examined the effects of rs16944 and rs1143643 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the IL1B gene on depressive and anxiety symptoms, as measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory, in a Hungarian population sample of 1053 persons. Distal and proximal environmental stress factors were also included in our analysis, namely childhood adversity and recent negative life-events. We found that rs16944 minor (A) allele specifically interacted with childhood adversity increasing depressive and anxiety symptoms, while rs1143643's minor (A) allele showed protective effect against depressive symptoms after recent life stress. The genetic main effects of the two SNPs were not significant in the main analysis, but the interaction effects remained significant after correction for multiple testing. In addition, the effect of rs16944 A allele was reversed in a subsample with low-exposure to life stress, suggesting a protective effect against depressive symptoms, in the post hoc analysis. In summary, both of the two IL1B SNPs showed specific environmental stressor-dependent effects on mood disorder symptoms. We also demonstrated that the presence of exposure to childhood adversity changed the direction of the rs16944 effect on depression phenotype. Therefore our results suggest that it is advisable to include environmental factors in genetic association studies when examining the effect of the IL1B gene.CI - Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

      "Abs: It is very likely that genetic factors play a role in the pathophysiology of cluster headache (CH). As CH shares its paroxysmal character with migraine, and migraine has been described in coexistence with CH in some families, we hypothesized that both diseases might share a genetic aetiology. In this study, we tested whether the migraine CACNA1A gene on chromosome 19 is involved in CH in an extended pedigree. Haplotype analysis did not reveal an obvious disease haplotype, and SSCP analysis of all 47 exons of the CACNA1A gene did not reveal a causative mutation. CH in this family is not caused by mutations in the CACNA1A gene.\n",

      "PMID:  17043155\n",
      "Abs: The antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA) is widely used in the treatment of epilepsy, bipolar disorders, and migraine. However, rather high doses are required for the clinical effects of VPA, which is due to its relatively inefficient delivery to the brain. The poor brain distribution of VPA is thought to reflect an asymmetric transport system at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Based on recent data from in vitro experiments, multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs) have been proposed to be involved in the efflux transport of VPA at the BBB. In the present study, we used different experimental in vitro and in vivo strategies to evaluate whether VPA is a substrate for MRPs or the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (Pgp). In contrast to known Pgp or MRP substrates, such as cyclosporin A or vinblastine, no directional transport of VPA was observed in cell monolayer efflux assays using the kidney cell lines Madin Darby canine kidney II and LLC-PK1, which had been transfected with either human or mouse cDNAs for the genes encoding Pgp, MRP1, or MRP2. Likewise, no indication for efflux transport of VPA was obtained in a rat microdialysis model, using inhibitors of either Pgp or MRPs. Furthermore, a significant role of MRP2 in brain efflux of VPA was excluded by using MRP2-deficient rats. Our data do not support the hypothesis that MRP1 or MRP2 is involved in the efflux of VPA from the brain. Thus, the molecular identity of the putative transporter(s) mediating the active efflux of VPA from the brain remains to be elucidated.\n",

      "PMID:  26797119\n",
      "Abs: Proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2) has been identified as the single causative gene for a group of paroxysmal syndromes of infancy, including epilepsy, paroxysmal movement disorders, and migraine. On the basis of topology predictions, PRRT2 has been assigned to the recently characterized family of Dispanins, whose members share the two-transmembrane domain topology with a large N terminus and short C terminus oriented toward the outside of the cell. Because PRRT2 plays a role at the synapse, it is important to confirm the exact orientation of its N and C termini with respect to the plasma membrane to get clues regarding its possible function. Using a combination of different experimental approaches, including live immunolabeling, immunogold electron microscopy, surface biotinylation and computational modeling, we demonstrate a novel topology for this protein. PRRT2 is a type II transmembrane protein in which only the second hydrophobic segment spans the plasma membrane, whereas the first one is associated with the internal surface of the membrane and forms a helix-loop-helix structure without crossing it. Most importantly, the large proline-rich N-terminal domain is not exposed to the extracellular space but is localized intracellularly, and only the short C terminus is extracellular (N cyt/C exo topology). Accordingly, we show that PRRT2 interacts with the Src homology 3 domain-bearing protein Intersectin 1, an intracellular protein involved in synaptic vesicle cycling. These findings will contribute to the clarification of the role of PRRT2 at the synapse and the understanding of pathogenic mechanisms on the basis of PRRT2-related neurological disorders.CI - © 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.\n",

      "PMID:  16195244\n",
      "Abs: Periodic paralyses (PPs) are rare inherited channelopathies that manifest as abnormal, often potassium (K)-sensitive, muscle membrane excitability leading to episodic flaccid paralysis. Hypokalaemic (HypoPP) and hyperkalaemic PP and Andersen-Tawil syndrome are genetically heterogeneous. Over the past decade mutations in genes encoding three ion channels, CACN1AS, SCN4A and KCNJ2, have been identified and account for at least 70% of the identified cases of PP and several allelic disorders. No prospective clinical studies have followed sufficiently large cohorts with characterized molecular lesions to draw precise conclusions. We summarize current knowledge of the clinical diagnosis, molecular genetics, genotype-phenotype correlations, pathophysiology and treatment in the PPs. We focus on unresolved issues including (i) Are there additional ion channel defects in cases without defined mutations? (ii) What is the mechanism for depolarization-induced weakness in Hypo PP? and finally (iii) Will detailed electrophysiological studies be able to correctly identify specific channel mutations? Understanding the pathophysiology of the potassium-sensitive PPs ought to reduce genetic complexity, allow subjects to be stratified during future clinical trials and increase the likelihood of observing true clinical effects. Ideally, therapy for the PPs will prevent attacks, avoid permanent weakness and improve quality of life. Moreover, understanding the skeletal muscle channelopathies will hopefully lead to insights into the more common central nervous system channel diseases such as migraine and epilepsy.\n",

      "PMID:  24895375\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) infusion in migraineurs provokes headache resembling spontaneous migraine, and CGRP receptor antagonists are effective in the treatment of acute migraine. We hypothesized that CGRP infusion would increase molecular markers of neuronal activation in migraine-relevant tissues of the rat. METHODS: CGRP was infused intravenously (i.v.) in freely moving rats to circumvent factors like anesthesia, acute surgery and severe hypotension, the three confounding factors for c-Fos expression. The trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) was isolated at different time points after CGRP infusion. The level of c-Fos mRNA and protein expression in TNC were analyzed by qPCR and immunohistochemistry. c-Fos-stained nuclei were also counted in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM), integrative sites in the brain stem for processing cardiovascular signals. We also investigated Zif268 protein expression (another immediate early gene) in TNC. The protein expression of p-ERK, p-CREB and c-Fos was analyzed in dura mater, trigeminal ganglion (TG) and TNC samples using Western blot. RESULTS: CGRP infusion caused a significant dose-dependent fall in mean arterial blood pressure. No significant activation of c-Fos in the TNC at mRNA and protein levels was observed after CGRP infusion. A significant increase in c-Fos protein was observed in the NTS and CVLM in the brain stem. Zif268 expression in the TNC was also not changed after CGRP infusion. p-ERK was increased in the dura mater 30 minutes after CGRP infusion. CONCLUSION: CGRP infusion increased the early expression of p-ERK in the dura mater but did not increase c-Fos and Zif268 expression in the TNC. The rats may, thus, differ from migraine patients, in whom infusion of CGRP caused headache and a delayed migraine attack. The rat CGRP infusion model with c-Fos or Zif268 as neuronal pain markers in TNC is unsuitable for antimigraine drug testing.CI - © International Headache Society 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.\n",

      "PMID:  26599579\n",
      "Abs: PURPOSE: Valproic acid (VPA), which is widely used to treat epilepsy, migraine, and bipolar disorder, can causes severe hyperammonemia. However, the mechanism responsible for this adverse effect is not readily apparent. We previously reported that phenytoin coadministration is a strong risk factor for the development of hyperammonemia during VPA-based therapy. In this study, we focused on glutamine synthetase, which catalyzes the synthesis of glutamine from glutamate and ammonia and examined the association with the development of hyperammonemia during VPA-based therapy. METHODS: For this study, we recruited 202 Japanese pediatric patients having epilepsy. We selected three polymorphisms (rs10911070, rs10797771, and rs10911021) in the glutamine synthetase (GLUL) gene. Hyperammonemia was defined as a plasma ammonia level exceeding 200 or 170 μg/dL. We evaluated the association between the development of hyperammonemia during VPA-based therapy and the patient characteristics, including three GLUL polymorphisms. RESULTS: The number of patients who developed hyperammonemia during VPA-based therapy was 20 (9.9%) using the 200 μg/dL cutoff value and 30 (14.9%) using the 170 μg/dL cutoff value. Using a multivariate logistic regression analysis, the GLUL rs10797771 polymorphism and phenytoin coadministration in the 200 μg/dL cutoff value, and female in addition to two factors in the 170 μg/dL cutoff value, had significant associations with a plasma ammonia level elevation during VPA-based therapy. CONCLUSION: Phenytoin coadministration, GLUL rs10797771 polymorphism in the 200μg/dL cutoff value, and female in addition to two factors in the 170μg/dL cutoff value, are independent risk factors for elevated plasma ammonia levels during VPA-based therapy.CI - Copyright © 2015 British Epilepsy Association.

      "PMID:  8069654\n",
      "Abs: Several members of a three-generation kindred from Sardinia were affected by a maternally inherited syndrome characterized by features of both myoclonus epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF) and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Clinically, symptoms such as myoclonus epilepsy, neural deafness and ataxia were variably associated with stroke-like episodes and/or migrainous attacks. Morphologically, numerous MELAS-associated SDH-stained vessels were observed in muscle biopsies, either alone or in combination with ragged-red fibers, the morphological hallmark of MERRF. Sequence analysis of the mtDNA tRNA genes revealed the presence of a single, heteroplasmic T-->C transition at nt 8356, in the region of the tRNA(Lys) gene corresponding to the T-psi-C stem. The T-->C(8356) transition was exclusively found in the maternal lineage of our family, and the relative amount of the mutant mtDNA species in muscle was correlated with the severity of the clinical presentation. Therefore, we propose that the T-->C(8356) transition is responsible for the mitochondrial encephalomyopathy found in our family, and must be added to the expanding list of the pathogenetically relevant mutations of human mtDNA.\n",

      "PMID:  11675581\n",
      "Abs: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarctions and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) was first reported in European families and since 1993 it has been observed in America, Africa and Asia, suggesting that today the disease probably still remains largely underdiagnosed. CADASIL appears to be essentially a disorder of the arteries linked to single missense mutations in the Notch3 gene locus on chromosome 19; the aberrant dimerisation of Notch3, due to abnormal disulphide bridging with another Notch3 molecule or with another protein, may be involved in the pathogenesis of the disorder. It is characterized by recurrent stroke episodes and focal neurologic deficits progressing to pseudobulbar palsy and dementia, caused by multiple lacunar infarctions with ischemic and diffuse white matter abnormalities on neuroimaging. Migraine with aura, epileptic seizures and affective disorders are frequent additional symptoms of CADASIL. It is usually observed in the 3rd decade, but some individuals remain asymptomatic close to the age of 60. MRI displays a marked leukoencephalopathy in affected individuals as early as in the age of 20. The authors emphasize the role of a direct DNA test for gene mutation to make a differential diagnosis between CADASIL and other forms of vascular leukoencephalopathy as Alzheimer's dementia, multiple sclerosis and Binswanger's subcortical arteriopathic encephalopathy where CADASIL's arteriopathy is characterized by major alterations of vascular smooth muscle cells and the presence of specific granular osmiophilic deposits.\n",

      "PMID:  27706811\n",
      "Abs: Intervention strategies in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients and other high-risk colorectal cancer (CRC) populations have highlighted a critical need for endoscopy combined with safe and effective preventive agents. We performed transcriptome profiling of colorectal adenomas from FAP patients and the polyposis in rat colon (Pirc) preclinical model, and prioritized molecular targets for prevention studies in vivo. At clinically relevant doses in the Pirc model, the drug Clotam (tolfenamic acid, TA) was highly effective at suppressing tumorigenesis both in the colon and in the small intestine, when administered alone or in combination with Sulindac. Cell proliferation in the colonic crypts was reduced significantly by TA, coincident with increased cleaved caspase-3 and decreased Survivin, β-catenin, cyclin D1 and matrix metalloproteinase 7. From the list of differentially expressed genes prioritized by transcriptome profiling, Mmp7, S100a9, Nppb and Aldh1a3 were defined as key oncogene candidates downregulated in colon tumors after TA treatment. Monthly colonoscopies revealed the rapid onset of tumor suppression by TA in the Pirc model, and the temporal changes in Mmp7, S100a9, Nppb and Aldh1a3, highlighting their value as potential early biomarkers for prevention in the clinical setting. We conclude that TA, an \"old drug\" repurposed from migraine, offers an exciting new therapeutic avenue in FAP and other high-risk CRC patient populations.CI - © 2016 UICC.\n",

      "PMID:  21335064\n",
      "Abs: Many chronic trigeminal pain conditions, such as migraine or temporo-mandibular disorders, are associated with inflammation within peripheral endings of trigeminal ganglion (TG) sensory neurons. A critical role in mechanisms of neuroinflammation is attributed to proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) that also contribute to mechanisms of persistent neuropathic pain resulting from nerve injury. However, the mechanisms of cytokine-mediated synaptic plasticity and nociceptor sensitization are not completely understood. In the present study, we examined the effects of TNFα on neuronal expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), whose role in synaptic plasticity and sensitization of nociceptive pathways is well documented. We show that 4- and 24-h treatment with TNFα increases BDNF mRNA and protein, respectively, in neuron-enriched dissociated cultures of rat TG. TNFα increases the phosphorylated form of the cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), a transcription factor involved in regulation of BDNF expression in neurons, and activates transcription of BDNF exon IV (former exon III) and, to a lesser extent, exon VI (former exon IV), but not exon I. TNFα-mediated increase in BDNF expression is accompanied by increase in calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which is consistent with previously published studies, and indicates that both peptides are similarly regulated in TG neurons by inflammatory mediators. The effect of TNFα on BDNF expression is dependent on sodium influx through TTX-sensitive channels and on p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase. Moreover, electrical stimulation and forskolin, known to increase intracellular cAMP, potentiate the TNFα-mediated upregulation of BDNF expression. This study provides new evidence for a direct action of proinflammatory cytokines on TG primary sensory neurons, and reveals a mechanism through which TNFα stimulates de novo synthesis of BDNF in these neurons. Thus, TNFα should be considered in mechanisms of BDNF-dependent neuronal plasticity.CI - Copyright © 2011 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "PMID:  11167915\n",
      "Abs: Migraine attacks can be provoked by administration of nitroglycerin, suggesting a role for nitric oxide (NO). The fact that release of the neuropeptide CGRP from trigeminal sensory nerves occurs during the pain phase of migraine and that NO can augment transmitter release prompted us to study CGRP release from the in situ dura mater in guinea pig skulls. Release of CGRP by capsaicin or by high potassium concentration was concentration-dependent and counteracted in calcium-free medium. The anti-migraine compound, sumatriptan, inhibited CGRP release via the 5-HT1-receptor. The NO donors, nitroglycerin, sodium nitroprusside and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine did not influence CGRP release, alone or together with the stimulants. We concluded that the skull preparation is well suited for scrutinizing CGRP release from dura mater. The fact that sumatriptan inhibits CGRP release as in migraine patients suggests a use for the present preparation in headache research.\n",

Therefore, in this chapter, the risks of long-term blockade of the CGRP pathway will be discussed, with focus on the cardiovascular system, as this peptide has been described to have a protective role during ischemic events, and migraine patients present a higher risk of stroke and myocardial infarction.\n",

Mechanisms leading to peripheral and central sensitization are relevant in chronification of migraine and tension-type headache.

      "PMID:  28007585\n",
      "Abs: Heterozygous and rare homozygous mutations in PRoline-Rich Transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2) underlie a group of paroxysmal disorders including epilepsy, kinesigenic dyskinesia episodic ataxia and migraine. Most of the mutations lead to impaired PRRT2 expression and/or function. Recently, an important role for PRTT2 in the neurotransmitter release machinery, brain development and synapse formation has been uncovered. In this work, we have characterized the phenotype of a mouse in which the PRRT2 gene has been constitutively inactivated (PRRT2 KO). β-galactosidase staining allowed to map the regional expression of PRRT2 that was more intense in the cerebellum, hindbrain and spinal cord, while it was localized to restricted areas in the forebrain. PRRT2 KO mice are normal at birth, but display paroxysmal movements at the onset of locomotion that persist in the adulthood. In addition, adult PRRT2 KO mice present abnormal motor behaviors characterized by wild running and jumping in response to audiogenic stimuli that are ineffective in wild type mice and an increased sensitivity to the convulsive effects of pentylentetrazol. Patch-clamp electrophysiology in hippocampal and cerebellar slices revealed specific effects in the cerebellum, where PRRT2 is highly expressed, consisting in a higher excitatory strength at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses during high frequency stimulation. The results show that the PRRT2 KO mouse reproduces the motor paroxysms present in the human PRRT2-linked pathology and can be proposed as an experimental model for the study of the pathogenesis of the disease as well as for testing personalized therapeutic approaches.CI - Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

      "Abs: AIM: To elucidate the natural course of benign paroxysmal torticollis, the relationship of this disorder to migraine and other paroxysmal diseases, and to analyse candidate genes. METHOD: This was a case series of children with benign paroxysmal torticollis of infancy (BPTI) diagnosed from 1998 to 2005, at Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. A neurological examination and a formalized motor assessment were performed from 2005 to 2007. At a second follow-up, in 2014 to 2015, the children and their parents were interviewed and candidate genes analysed. RESULTS: The mean age of the eight females and three males included in the second follow-up was 13 years 9 months (SD 2y 2mo). All motor assessments were normal. Five had developed migraine, abdominal migraine, and/or cyclic vomiting. Prophylactic treatment or migraine-specific medication during attacks were not needed. No paroxysmal tonic upgaze, benign paroxysmal vertigo, epilepsy, episodic ataxia, or paroxysmal dyskinesia was reported. Rare genetic variants in CACNA1A and ATP1A2 were found in two children. Five had a family history of migraine. INTERPRETATION: BPTI is transient and does not lead to neurological sequelae. Most children afflicted experience either a mild migraine or no paroxysmal disorder at all in their adolescence. Genetic variants in candidate genes were few, indicating potential genetic heterogeneity. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: After resolution of their benign paroxysmal torticollis of infancy (BPTI), children display no gross motor delay. Most adolescents who previously had BPTI have not developed migraine. No mutations in candidate genes, known to cause hemiplegic migraine, were found. Associated symptoms are often lacking during episodes of torticollis.CI - © 2018 Mac Keith Press.\n",

      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: A genome-wide scan of gene expression in leucocytes in Asian Indians with type 2 diabetes was performed and correlated with their known phenotype. METHODS: Microarray gene profiling of 13,474 sequence-verified, non-redundant human cDNAs was done to study leukocyte gene expression in Asian Indians with type 2 diabetes (DM: n=3) and matched controls (n=3). RESULTS: Significant differential expression (fold change <0.3 or >3) was noted for 897 genes in DM vs. controls. The 147 known genes in this category belonged to following broad functional groups (%): enzyme (32), nucleic acid binding (22), ligand binding or carrier (10), signal transducer (9), transporter (7), structural protein (6), cell adhesion (3), tumor suppressor (3), transcription factor binding (2), enzyme inhibitor (2), chaperone (2), cell cycle regulator (1), and defense/immunity protein (1). The 20 genes with at least a 3-fold change, annotated with known phenotypic associations in the current gene databank (phenotype association, fold change) were aspartoacylase (Canavan disease, 9.96), growth hormone receptor (Laron dwarfism, idiopathic short stature, 8.25), lipoprotein lipase (familial chylomicronemia syndrome, lipoprotein lipase deficiency, 8.00), vitamin D (1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D3) receptor (involutional osteoporosis, vitamin D resistant rickets, 7.94), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 human rhinovirus receptor (cerebral malaria susceptibility, 7.16), peroxisomal membrane protein 3 35-kDa (Refsum disease, infantile form, Zellweger syndrome-3, 6.00), Bardet-Biedl syndrome 2 (Bardet-Biedl syndrome, 5.87), ribosomal protein S19 (Diamond Blackfan anemia, 5.85), apolipoprotein C-III (hypertriglyceridemia, 5.44), argininosuccinate lyase (argininosuccinicaciduria, 5.22), myosin VA (Griscelli syndrome-type pigmentary dilution with mental retardation, 4.92), lysozyme (renal amyloidosis, 4.17), SAM domain, SH3 domain and nuclear localisation signals 1 (Cherubism, 4.12 ), von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (hemangioblastoma, cerebellar, somatic, von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, 3.94), early-onset breast cancer 1 (BRCA1, papillary serous carcinoma of the peritoneum, 3.73), UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (inclusion body myopathy, autosomal recessive, sialuria, 3.53), apolipoprotein A-I (amyloidosis, 3 or more types, hypoalphalipoproteinemia, 3.29), midline 1 Opitz/BBB syndrome (Opitz G syndrome, type I, 3.28), ATPase, Na+/K+ transporting, alpha 2 (+) polypeptide (familial hemiplegic migraine, 3.05). Canavan disease, Zellweger syndrome, infantile Refsum disease, Griscelli syndrome, cherubism, breast cancer, peritoneal papillary serous carcinoma, Opitz G/BBB syndrome, and familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) are phenotypes not previously reported in association with type 2 DM, but whose underlying genes were up-regulated in this peripheral genome scan of Asian Indians. CONCLUSION: Rare and/or previously unknown phenotypes linked to known genes with significant differential expression in type 2 DM are reported. Further testing of heterogeneity in diabetes phenotype syndromes may reveal common pathogenic mechanisms and potential candidate genes responsible for type 2 DM.\n",

      "Abs: Up-regulation of germacrene A synthase and down-regulation of parthenolide hydroxylase genes play key role in parthenolide accumulation of feverfew plants treated with methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid. Parthenolide is an important sesquiterpene lactone due to its anti-migraine and anti-cancer properties. Parthenolide amount was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography after foliar application of methyl jasmonate (100 µM) or salicylic acid (1.0 mM) on feverfew leaves in time course experiment (3-96 h). Results indicate that exogenous application of methyl jasmonate or salicylic acid activated parthenolide biosynthesis. Parthenolide content reached its highest amount at 24 h after methyl jasmonate or salicylic acid treatments, which were 3.1- and 1.96-fold higher than control plants, respectively. Parthenolide transiently increased due to methyl jasmonate or salicylic acid treatments until 24 h, but did not show significant difference compared with control plants at 48 and 96 h time points in both treatments. Also, the transcript levels of early pathway (upstream) genes of terpene biosynthesis including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase and hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate reductase and the biosynthetic genes of parthenolide including germacrene A synthase, germacrene A oxidase, costunolide synthase and parthenolide synthase were increased by methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid treatments, but with different intensity. The transcriptional levels of these genes were higher in methyl jasmonate-treated plants than salicylic acid-treated plants. Parthenolide content measurements along with expression pattern analysis of the aforementioned genes and parthenolide hydroxylase as side branch gene of parthenolide suggest that the expression patterns of early pathway genes were not directly consistent with parthenolide accumulation pattern; hence, parthenolide accumulation is probably further modulated by the expression of its biosynthetic genes, especially germacrene A synthase and also its side branch gene, parthenolide hydroxylase.\n",

      "Title: Recent advances in the genetics of recurrent vertigo and vestibulopathy\n",
      "PMID:  18180645\n",
      "Abs: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To focus on recent advances in the genetics of recurrent vertigo, with an overview on episodic ataxia, benign recurrent vertigo (mainly migraine-associated vertigo), bilateral vestibulopathy, and Ménière's disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Since the identification more than a decade ago of the genetic causes of episodic ataxia type 1 with myokymia caused by KCNA1 mutations and episodic ataxia type 2 with nystagmus caused by CACNA1A mutations, the list of episodic ataxia syndromes with distinct clinical features and genetic loci is slowly expanding, now up to episodic ataxia type 7. There is growing recognition for a correlation between benign recurrent vertigo and migraine, and acceptance for vertigo as a manifestation of migraine; efforts to identify susceptibility loci for migraine and migraine-associated vertigo are underway. A handful of families with vestibulopathy spanning several generations have been identified. Although no gene has yet been found, vestibulopathy with normal hearing variably associated with migraine is likely monogenic and heterogeneous, similar to nonsydromic deafness. There is also continuing effort to identify genetic causes of familial Ménière's disease. SUMMARY: Overlapping clinical features among different familial syndromes of recurrent vertigo and strong association with migraine suggest shared mechanisms. Collaborative efforts in patient identification and recruitment will facilitate progress in understanding disease mechanisms to improve diagnosis and treatment of recurrent vertigo.\n",

      "PMID:  12052194\n",
      "Abs: The human 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(1D) receptors are especially similar in sequence despite being encoded by two distinct genes. Although, human 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(1D) receptors have been pharmacologically differentiated using nonselective 5-HT(1B/D) receptor antagonists such as ketanserin (1), ritanserin (2) and methiothepin (3), the precise function of these receptors remains undefined, and progress toward this has been hampered by the lack of selective ligands. The interest of the major pharmaceutical companies in 5-HT(1B/1D) antagonists increased by the discovery of potent and selective tools, combined with the fact that the blockade of terminal 5-HT(1B) receptors by selective antagonists has been proposed as a new approach for more efficient and/or fast-acting antidepressant drugs, since the acute blockade of these 5-HT autoreceptors will, in theory, immediately mimic their desensitization. Furthermore, it has been also suggested that supersensitive 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors may be involved in the pathophysiology of obsessive compulsive disorders (OCD). In the 5-HT(1B/1D) agonist field, since the discovery of sumatriptan (26) (a 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist) as an effective treatment for migraine headache, intensive research in this area has led to several second-generation compounds, a few of which have either entered the market place or are in late clinical trials. Beside the antimigraine activity of the 5-HT(1B/1D) agonists in clinical evaluation or already on the market, other potential therapeutic evaluations (such as gastric motor effect, bipolar disorder, autism, anti-aggressive effects) with these drugs are being investigated. This article highlights and reviews the research advances published in the 5-HT(1B/1D) antagonist and agonist literature. The article is supplemented with selected references on the design, synthesis and development of novel 5-HT(1B/1D) agents, and on studies to understand their mechanism and pathophysiology. Emphasis is given to recent advances in the potential therapeutic applications of 5-HT(1B/1D) serotonergic agents. By no means has any attempt been made to exhaustively review the literature but rather, primary references along with citations to recent literature reviews have been included in each section.\n",

      "PMID:  22638077\n",
      "Abs: Mutations in the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b gene (MTCYB) have been commonly associated with isolated mitochondrial myopathy and exercise intolerance, rarely with multisystem disorders, and only once with a parkinsonism/mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS) overlap syndrome. Here, we describe a novel mutation (m.14864 T>C) in MTCYB in a 15-year-old girl with a clinical history of migraines, epilepsy, sensorimotor neuropathy, and strokelike episodes, a clinical picture reminiscent of MELAS. The mutation, which changes a highly conserved cysteine to arginine at amino acid position 40 of cytochrome b, was heteroplasmic in muscle, blood, fibroblasts, and urinary sediment from the patient but absent in accessible tissues from her asymptomatic mother. This case demonstrates that MTCYB must be included in the already long list of mitochondrial DNA genes that have been associated with the MELAS phenotype.\n",

      "PMID:  29237283\n",
      "Abs: Background According to the neurovascular theory of migraine, activation of the trigeminovascular system contributes to the development of migraine. This study examined the effects of chronic intraperitoneal ghrelin (150 µg/kg) treatment on the development of chronic migraine induced by intermittent injection of nitroglycerin 10 mg/kg. Methods Baseline and post-drug (2 h following nitroglycerin injection) mechanical and thermal sensitivity were assessed by von Frey hair and tail immersion tests, respectively on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11. Moreover, we investigated the effect of ghrelin treatment on nitroglycerin-induced aversive behavior by using a two-chamber conditioned place aversion paradigm. At the end of behavioral testing, on day 11, animals were sacrificed and plasma concentration of calcitonin gene-related peptide was measured using a rat-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Also, real time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify mRNA expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 in the trigeminal ganglion. Results Our results indicated that nitroglycerin activated the trigeminovascular system, which was reflected by mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity and elevation of mRNA expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide and transient receptor potential vanilloid-1, as migraine markers, and plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide levels. Moreover, chronic nitroglycerin injection induced conditioned place aversion and body weight loss. Nevertheless, ghrelin modulated nitroglycerin-triggered changes in transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 and calcitonin gene-related peptide expression, and mitigated nitroglycerin-induced hyperalgesia. Conclusion These results provide the first convincing evidence that ghrelin has a modulating effect on central sensitization induced by chronic intermittent nitroglycerin, and its antinociceptive effect may be related to a reduction of these factors in the trigeminal ganglion.\n",

      "PMID:  20100831\n",
      "Abs: Voltage-gated sodium channels are required for the initiation and propagation of action potentials. Mutations in the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel SCN1A are associated with a growing number of disorders including generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+),(7) severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, and familial hemiplegic migraine. To gain insight into the effect of SCN1A mutations on neuronal excitability, we introduced the human GEFS+ mutation SCN1A-R1648H into the orthologous mouse gene. Scn1a(RH/RH) mice homozygous for the R1648H mutation exhibit spontaneous generalized seizures and premature death between P16 and P26, whereas Scn1a(RH/+) heterozygous mice exhibit infrequent spontaneous generalized seizures, reduced threshold and accelerated propagation of febrile seizures, and decreased threshold to flurothyl-induced seizures. Inhibitory cortical interneurons from P5-P15 Scn1a(RH/+) and Scn1a(RH/RH) mice demonstrated slower recovery from inactivation, greater use-dependent inactivation, and reduced action potential firing compared with wild-type cells. Excitatory cortical pyramidal neurons were mostly unaffected. These results suggest that this SCN1A mutation predominantly impairs sodium channel activity in interneurons, leading to decreased inhibition. Decreased inhibition may be a common mechanism underlying clinically distinct SCN1A-derived disorders.\n",

      "Title: Neuropeptide and Small Transmitter Coexistence: Fundamental Studies and Relevance to Mental Illness\n",
      "PMID:  30627087\n",
      "Abs: Neuropeptides are auxiliary messenger molecules that always co-exist in nerve cells with one or more small molecule (classic) neurotransmitters. Neuropeptides act both as transmitters and trophic factors, and play a role particularly when the nervous system is challenged, as by injury, pain or stress. Here neuropeptides and coexistence in mammals are reviewed, but with special focus on the 29/30 amino acid galanin and its three receptors GalR1, -R2 and -R3. In particular, galanin's role as a co-transmitter in both rodent and human noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) neurons is addressed. Extensive experimental animal data strongly suggest a role for the galanin system in depression-like behavior. The translational potential of these results was tested by studying the galanin system in postmortem human brains, first in normal brains, and then in a comparison of five regions of brains obtained from depressed people who committed suicide, and from matched controls. The distribution of galanin and the four galanin system transcripts in the normal human brain was determined, and selective and parallel changes in levels of transcripts and DNA methylation for galanin and its three receptors were assessed in depressed patients who committed suicide: upregulation of transcripts, e.g., for galanin and GalR3 in LC, paralleled by a decrease in DNA methylation, suggesting involvement of epigenetic mechanisms. It is hypothesized that, when exposed to severe stress, the noradrenergic LC neurons fire in bursts and release galanin from their soma/dendrites. Galanin then acts on somato-dendritic, inhibitory galanin autoreceptors, opening potassium channels and inhibiting firing. The purpose of these autoreceptors is to act as a 'brake' to prevent overexcitation, a brake that is also part of resilience to stress that protects against depression. Depression then arises when the inhibition is too strong and long lasting - a maladaption, allostatic load, leading to depletion of NA levels in the forebrain. It is suggested that disinhibition by a galanin antagonist may have antidepressant activity by restoring forebrain NA levels. A role of galanin in depression is also supported by a recent candidate gene study, showing that variants in genes for galanin and its three receptors confer increased risk of depression and anxiety in people who experienced childhood adversity or recent negative life events. In summary, galanin, a neuropeptide coexisting in LC neurons, may participate in the mechanism underlying resilience against a serious and common disorder, MDD. Existing and further results may lead to an increased understanding of how this illness develops, which in turn could provide a basis for its treatment.\n",

      "PMID:  23643980\n",
      "Abs: The comorbidity between migraine and depression not only provides a major treatment challenge, but also represents a heavy burden on society. However, the relationship between depression and migraine and their molecular biological mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated the effects of depression elicited by unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) on trigeminovascular nociception in conscious rats and detected a concentration of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP) in the external jugular vein. We divided the rats into four groups: control-stimulated (C/S), control-nonstimulated (C/NS), UCMS-stimulated (U/S), and UCMS-nonstimulated (U/NS). We stimulated the dura mater adjacent to the superior sagittal sinus of rats in the C/S and U/S groups and observed their nociceptive behaviors. We found significant differences between the UCMS and control groups in weight, sucrose preference, and locomotor behavior. Nociceptive behaviors (number of head flicks and head-turning time) were significantly increased in the U/S compared with the C/S group, and head-turning time correlated with depressive-like behaviors. The plasma level of SP was increased significantly in the U/NS compared with the C/NS group. However, no significant differences involving the other groups were observed. UCMS-induced depression can exacerbate trigeminovascular nociception, making rats more sensitive to pain.CI - Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "PMID:  25792688\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonism is an approach to migraine therapy. The locus of action of antimigraine treatment is not resolved. The objective was to investigate CGRP receptors in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) involved in the modulation of trigeminovascular nociception by descending influences on neurotransmission. METHODS: The presence of calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity modifying protein 1 (RAMP1), which form functional CGRP receptors, was investigated. CGRP and its receptor antagonists, olcegepant and CGRP (8-37), were microinjected into the vlPAG while changes of neural responses in the trigeminocervical complex (TCC) were monitored. RESULTS: Immunoreactivity indicated the presence of functional CGRP receptor components in the vlPAG and adjacent mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus. Inhibition of TCC responses to stimulation of dural afferents and ophthalmic cutaneous receptive fields after microinjection of bicuculline into vlPAG indicated a connection between the vlPAG and TCC neurons. CGRP facilitated these TCC responses, whereas olcegepant and CGRP (8-37) decreased them. CONCLUSIONS: CGRP and its receptor antagonists act on neurons in the region of vlPAG to influence nociceptive transmission in the TCC. This suggests CGRP receptor antagonists may act at loci outside of the TCC and reinforces the concept of migraine as a disorder of the brain.CI - © International Headache Society 2015.\n",

      "PMID:  23123284\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) play an important role in the development of pain and migraine pathogenesis. Increase in plasma CGRP levels is associated with delayed migraine-like attacks in migraine patients. Although several lines of evidence have indicated a key role of CGRP in migraine pain, its mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the functional role of CGRP on trigeminal nociceptive pathway by determining the alteration in TRPV1 levels in trigeminal ganglion (TG) and the activation of trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) of rat. Post intravenous injection of CGRP (600ng/kg) at 60min significantly increased the levels of TRPV1, CGRP, phosphorylated protein kinase C and phosphorylated cyclic AMP responsive element-binding protein in TG of rats. The number of small and medium TRPV1 and CGRP positive immunostaining neurons accompanying with co-localization of TRPV1 with CGRP neurons were significantly increased in TG of CGRP-injected rats. The sustained increase in c-Fos expression in TNC neurons was also observed in CGRP-injected rats. These results indicate that CGRP may participate in trigeminal nociceptive system sensitization by induced increase in TRPV1 and CGRP levels in TG neurons and activation of the central neurons in TNC.CI - Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

      "PMID:  24725338\n",
      "Abs: Valproic acid (VPA) is a widely used antiepileptic drug and also prescribed to treat migraine, chronic headache and bipolar disorder. Although it is usually well tolerated, a severe hepatotoxic reaction has been repeatedly reported after VPA administration. A profound toxic reaction on administration of VPA has been observed in several patients carrying POLG mutations, and heterozygous genetic variation in POLG has been strongly associated with VPA-induced liver toxicity. Here we studied the effect of VPA in fibroblasts of five patients carrying pathogenic mutations in the POLG gene. VPA administration caused a significant increase in the expression of POLG and several regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis. It was further supported by elevated mtDNA copy numbers. The effect of VPA on mitochondrial biogenesis was observed in both control and patient cell lines, but the capacity of mutant POLG to increase the expression of mitochondrial genes and to increase mtDNA copy numbers was less effective. No evidence of substantive differences in DNA methylation across the genome was observed between POLG mutated patients and controls. Given the marked perturbation of gene expression observed in the cell lines studied, we conclude that altered DNA methylation is unlikely to make a major contribution to POLG-mediated VPA toxicity. Our data provide experimental evidence that VPA triggers increased mitochondrial biogenesis by altering the expression of several mitochondrial genes; however, the capacity of POLG-deficient liver cells to address the increased metabolic rate caused by VPA administration is significantly impaired.CI - Copyright © 2014 The Authors.

      "PMID:  28972120\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), the most abundant neuropeptide in primary afferent sensory neurons, is strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine headache, but its role in migraine is still equivocal. As a new approach to migraine treatment, humanized anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (CGRP-mAbs) were developed to reduce the availability of CGRP, and were found effective in reducing the frequency of chronic and episodic migraine. We recently tested the effect of fremanezumab (TEV-48125), a CGRP-mAb, on the activity of second-order trigeminovascular dorsal horn neurons that receive peripheral input from the cranial dura, and found a selective inhibition of high-threshold but not wide-dynamic range class of neurons. To investigate the basis for this selective inhibitory effect, and further explore the mechanism of action of CGRP-mAbs, we tested the effect of fremanezumab on the cortical spreading depression-evoked activation of mechanosensitive primary afferent meningeal nociceptors that innervate the cranial dura, using single-unit recording in the trigeminal ganglion of anesthetized male rats. Fremanezumab pretreatment selectively inhibited the responsiveness of Aδ neurons, but not C-fiber neurons, as reflected in a decrease in the percentage of neurons that showed activation by cortical spreading depression. These findings identify Aδ meningeal nociceptors as a likely site of action of fremanezumab in the prevention of headache. The selectivity in its peripheral inhibitory action may partly account for fremanezumab's selective inhibition of high-threshold, as a result of a predominant A-δ input to high-threshold neurons, but not wide dynamic-range dorsal horn neurons, and why it may not be effective in all migraine patients.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Recently, we reported that humanized CGRP monoclonal antibodies (CGRP-mAbs) prevent activation and sensitization of high-threshold (HT) but not wide-dynamic range trigeminovascular neurons by cortical spreading depression (CSD). In the current paper, we report that CGRP-mAbs prevent the activation of Aδ but not C-type meningeal nociceptors by CSD. This is the first identification of an anti-migraine drug that appears to be selective for Aδ-fibers (peripherally) and HT neurons (centrally). As the main CGRP-mAb site of action appears to be situated outside the brain, we conclude that the initiation of the headache phase of migraine depends on activation of meningeal nociceptors, and that for selected patients, activation of the Aδ-HT pain pathway may be sufficient for the generation of headache perception.CI - Copyright © 2017 the authors 0270-6474/17/3710587-10$15.00/0.\n",

      "Title: Induction of calcitonin gene-related peptide expression in rats by cortical spreading depression\n",
      "PMID:  27919019\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has now been established as a key player in migraine. However, the mechanisms underlying the reported elevation of CGRP in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of some migraineurs are not known. A candidate mechanism is cortical spreading depression (CSD), which is associated with migraine with aura and traumatic brain injury. The aim of this study was to investigate whether CGRP gene expression may be induced by experimental CSD in the rat cerebral cortex. METHODS: CSD was induced by topical application of KCl and monitored using electrophysiological methods. Quantitative PCR and ELISA were used to measure CGRP mRNA and peptide levels in discrete ipsilateral and contralateral cortical regions of the rat brain 24 hours following CSD events and compared with sham treatments. RESULTS: The data show that multiple, but not single, CSD events significantly increase CGRP mRNA levels at 24 hours post-CSD in the ipsilateral rat cerebral cortex. Increased CGRP was observed in the ipsilateral frontal, motor, somatosensory, and visual cortices, but not the cingulate cortex, or contralateral cortices. CSD also induced CGRP peptide expression in the ipsilateral, but not contralateral, cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated CSD provides a mechanism for prolonged elevation of CGRP in the cerebral cortex, which may contribute to migraine and post-traumatic headache.\n",

      "PMID:  24036374\n",
      "Abs: Indirect evidence suggests the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in migraine pathophysiology. In the current study we measured lipid peroxidation product in the rat cortex, trigeminal ganglia and meninges after the induction of cortical spreading depression (CSD), a phenomenon known to be associated with migraine aura, and tested nociceptive firing triggered by ROS in trigeminal nerves ex vivo. Application of KCl to dura mater in anesthetized rats induced several waves of CSD recorded by an extracellular electrode in the cortex. Following CSD, samples of cortex (affected regions were identified with blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)), meninges from left and right hemispheres and trigeminal ganglia were taken for biochemical analysis. We found that CSD increased the level of the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex and meninges, but also in both ipsi- and contralateral trigeminal ganglia. In order to test the pro-nociceptive action of ROS, we applied the mild oxidant hydrogen peroxide to isolated rat hemiskull preparations including preserved trigeminal innervations. Application of hydrogen peroxide to meninges transiently enhanced electrical spiking activity of trigeminal nerves showing a pro-nociceptive action of ROS. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide trigeminal nerves still responded to capsaicin by burst of spiking activity indicating integrity of neuronal structures. The action of hydrogen peroxide was mediated by TRPA1 receptors as it was abolished by the specific TRPA1 antagonist TCS-5861528. Using dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons as test system we found that hydrogen peroxide promoted the release of the migraine mediator calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which we previously identified as a trigger of delayed sensitization of trigeminal neurons. Our data suggest that, after CSD, oxidative stress spreads downstream within the trigeminal nociceptive system and could be involved in the coupling of CSD with the activation of trigeminovascular system in migraine pathology.CI - Copyright © 2013 IBRO.

      "Title: 4991W93 inhibits release of calcitonin gene-related peptide in the cat but only at doses with 5HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist activity?PG - 520-5AB - Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a marker for trigeminovascular activation and is released during the headache phase of migraine and cluster headache. CGRP may have a role in migraine through its potent cranial vasodilator effects, or by an action on trigeminal nerve activity, both of which are targeted by 5HT(1B/1D) agonist drugs. CP122,288, a conformationally restricted analogue of sumatriptan that is a potent inhibitor of neurogenic plasma protein extravasation (PPE), was ineffective at inhibiting CGRP release at a single low dose; and is also ineffective as an acute anti-migraine compound. However, it remained unclear as to whether, as a class, the conformationally-restricted triptan analogues could have inhibitory effects on CGRP in higher doses. 4991W93, a conformationally restricted analogue of zolmitriptan, is also a potent inhibitor of PPE at doses without 5HT(1B/1D)-mediated effects, that was developed as an anti-migraine drug, and thus was suitable to test whether higher doses of such conformationally restricted triptan analogues could inhibit trigeminal-evoked CGRP release. The superior sagittal sinus (SSS) was stimulated in 14 anaesthetised cats and external jugular vein blood samples were analysed by radioimmunoassay for CGRP levels before, 1 min after SSS stimulation, and 1 min after SSS stimulation in the presence of 4991W93. Stimulation of the SSS resulted in release of CGRP from the external jugular vein. 4991W93 at a dose of 0.1 and 10 microg/kg, selected for maximal PPE blocking effects in rodents, was ineffective at inhibiting CGRP release, with an SSS stimulation level of 78+/-4 pmol/l compared to a post-4991W93 level of 79+/-3 pmol/l (n=4). In comparison CGRP release was inhibited after a dose of 100 microg/kg 4991W93 from 64+/-6 to 36+/-3 pmol/l (n=5). Given that 4991W93 is inactive clinically at non-vascular doses, it seems clear that the 5HT(1B/1D) agonist effects of the compound are necessary for blockade of CGRP release and thus any anti-migraine action.

      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a marker for trigeminovascular activation and is released during the headache phase of migraine and cluster headache. CGRP may have a role in migraine through its potent cranial vasodilator effects, or by an action on trigeminal nerve activity, both of which are targeted by 5HT(1B/1D) agonist drugs. CP122,288, a conformationally restricted analogue of sumatriptan that is a potent inhibitor of neurogenic plasma protein extravasation (PPE), was ineffective at inhibiting CGRP release at a single low dose; and is also ineffective as an acute anti-migraine compound. However, it remained unclear as to whether, as a class, the conformationally-restricted triptan analogues could have inhibitory effects on CGRP in higher doses. 4991W93, a conformationally restricted analogue of zolmitriptan, is also a potent inhibitor of PPE at doses without 5HT(1B/1D)-mediated effects, that was developed as an anti-migraine drug, and thus was suitable to test whether higher doses of such conformationally restricted triptan analogues could inhibit trigeminal-evoked CGRP release. The superior sagittal sinus (SSS) was stimulated in 14 anaesthetised cats and external jugular vein blood samples were analysed by radioimmunoassay for CGRP levels before, 1 min after SSS stimulation, and 1 min after SSS stimulation in the presence of 4991W93. Stimulation of the SSS resulted in release of CGRP from the external jugular vein. 4991W93 at a dose of 0.1 and 10 microg/kg, selected for maximal PPE blocking effects in rodents, was ineffective at inhibiting CGRP release, with an SSS stimulation level of 78+/-4 pmol/l compared to a post-4991W93 level of 79+/-3 pmol/l (n=4).

      "PMID:  25290014\n",
      "Abs: The association between the clinical use of nitroglycerin (NTG) and migraine suggests NTG as an animal model trigger for migraine. NTG-induced hyperalgesia in rats has been extensively used as a migraine model for pre-clinical research. Pregabalin is an anti-epileptic drug and may play a role in the preventive treatment of migraine; however, the mechanism of this action remains to be clarified. Herein, we performed the present study to investigate the effect of pregabalin on the NTG-induced hyperalgesia in rats. Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided equally into six groups. Thirty minutes before NTG injection, the rats were pretreated with pregabalin. von Frey hair testing was employed to evaluate tactile sensitivity. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to analyze plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) levels in the jugular vein. Immunohistochemistry was applied to detect c-Fos-immunoreactive neurons and western blot was performed to detect c-Fos protein expression in trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC). We found that pregabalin pretreatment alleviated the NTG-induced hyperalgesia. Moreover, pregabalin suppressed peripheral CGRP release, c-Fos-immunoreactive neurons and the protein expression of c-Fos in TNC as well. These data suggest that pregabalin could alleviate the NTG-induced hyperalgesia. Further studies are required to determine the mechanisms of action for this effect.CI - Copyright © 2014 IBRO.

      "PMID:  20802202\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists are effective acute migraine treatments without the vascular contraindications associated with triptans. While it has been demonstrated that calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists act in the central nervous system, their effects in preclinical migraine models have been investigated in only the trigeminocervical complex. Migraine is a complex neurological disorder; sites in the brainstem and forebrain are clearly involved in its expression. We have performed electrophysiological recordings in thalamic neurons of rats responding to nocioceptive trigeminovascular inputs and tested the effect of olcegepant, a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist (1 mg/kg, intravenously), on cell firing. We further tested the effect of microiontophoresed calcitonin gene-related peptide and the receptor antagonists calcitonin gene-related peptide 8-37 and olcegepant on thalamic cell firing, elicited by stimulation of the superior sagittal sinus or by microiontophoretic application of l-glutamate. Additionally, we used immunofluorescent staining to demonstrate the presence of functional calcitonin gene-related peptide receptors in the ventroposteromedial thalamic nucleus by specifically co-staining for the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor subunits calcitonin receptor-like receptor and receptor activity modifying protein 1. Intravenously administered olcegepant significantly inhibited cell firing evoked by stimulation of the superior sagittal sinus as well as the background activity. Microiontophoresis of calcitonin gene-related peptide 8-37 also showed a significant inhibition of l-glutamate-evoked cell firing and firing evoked by stimulation of the superior sagittal sinus. Immunofluorescent staining confirmed the presence of the components of a functional calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, the calcitonin receptor-like receptor and the receptor activity modifying protein 1, within the area of the ventroposteromedial thalamic nucleus. This is the first report on the efficacy of calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists at the level of third-order neurons in the migraine pathway, showing that the central effects of calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists extend beyond the trigeminocervical complex at least to the sensory thalamus.\n",

      "PMID:  26944272\n",
      "Abs: Recent publications on both the genetics and environmental factors of restless legs syndrome (RLS) defined as a clinical disorder suggest that overlapping genetic risk factors may play a role in primary (idiopathic) and secondary (symptomatic) RLS. Following a systematic literature search of RLS associated with comorbidities, we identified an increased prevalence of RLS only in iron deficiency and kidney disease. In cardiovascular disease, arterial hypertension, diabetes, migraine, and Parkinson disease, the methodology of studies was poor, but an association might be possible. There is insufficient evidence for conditions such as anemia (without iron deficiency), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, multiple sclerosis, headache, stroke, narcolepsy, and ataxias. Based on possible gene-microenvironmental interaction, the classifications primary and secondary RLS may suggest an inappropriate causal relation. We recognize that in some conditions, treatment of the underlying disease should be achieved as far as possible to reduce or eliminate RLS symptoms. RLS might be seen as a continuous spectrum with a major genetic contribution at one end and a major environmental or comorbid disease contribution at the other.CI - © 2016 American Academy of Neurology.\n",

      "PMID:  18216301\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanisms underlying myoclonus in Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). METHODS: Five patients and one unaffected carrier from two Italian families bearing the homoplasmic 11778/ND4 and 3460/ND1 mutations underwent a uniform investigation including neurophysiologic studies, muscle biopsy, serum lactic acid after exercise, and muscle ((31)P) and cerebral ((1)H) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Biochemical investigations on fibroblasts and complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences of both families were also performed. RESULTS: All six individuals had myoclonus. In spite of a normal EEG background and the absence of giant SEPs and C reflex, EEG-EMG back-averaging showed a preceding jerk-locked EEG potential, consistent with a cortical generator of the myoclonus. Specific comorbidities in the 11778/ND4 family included muscular cramps and psychiatric disorders, whereas features common to both families were migraine and cardiologic abnormalities. Signs of mitochondrial proliferation were seen in muscle biopsies and lactic acid elevation was observed in four of six patients. (31)P-MRS was abnormal in five of six patients and (1)H-MRS showed ventricular accumulation of lactic acid in three of six patients. Fibroblast ATP depletion was evident at 48 hours incubation with galactose in LHON/myoclonus patients. Sequence analysis revealed haplogroup T2 (11778/ND4 family) and U4a (3460/ND1 family) mtDNAs. A functional role for the non-synonymous 4136A>G/ND1, 9139G>A/ATPase6, and 15773G>A/cyt b variants was supported by amino acid conservation analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Myoclonus and other comorbidities characterized our Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) families. Functional investigations disclosed a bioenergetic impairment in all individuals. Our sequence analysis suggests that the LHON plus phenotype in our cases may relate to the synergic role of mtDNA variants.\n",

      "PMID:  18367436\n",
      "Abs: CaV 2.1 voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are highly expressed by cerebellar neurons, and their dysfunction is linked to human disorders including familial hemiplegic migraine, episodic ataxia type 2 and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6. Altered calcium homeostasis, due to dysfunctional Ca(V 2.1 VGCC can severely affect mitochondrial function, eventually leading to neuronal cell death. We study leaner and tottering mice, which carry autosomal recessive mutations in the gene coding for the alpha 1A pore-forming subunit of CaV 2.1 VGCC. Both leaner and tottering mice exhibit cerebellar ataxia and epilepsy. Excessive leaner cerebellar granule cell (CGC) death starts soon after postnatal day 10, but it is not known whether the degree of CGC cell death observed in adult leaner mice is significantly different from wild type mice. We used Fluoro-Jade and TUNEL staining to quantify apoptotic cell death in leaner and wild type CGC. We investigated calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial function and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in isolated CGC, using indicator dyes Fura-2AM, TMRM and CMH2DCFDA, respectively. We observed a small but significant increase in number of apoptotic adult leaner CGC. Calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function also were altered in leaner CGC. However, no significant differences in ROS levels were observed. It is possible that CGC death in leaner mice may be related to mitochondrial dysfunction but may not be directly related to decreased basal intracellular calcium.\n",

      "Abs: A 17-year-old girl presented with migraine with prolonged aura and aura without headache. Neurologic examination was normal. Her mother, who did not have a history of migraine, developed right-face and -arm numbness at the age of 45. Evaluation revealed white matter changes consistent with CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy), and genetic testing showed a Notch3 gene mutation consistent with CADASIL. Our patient's MRI revealed white matter changes and the same Notch3 gene mutation. Low-dose aspirin was started in an attempt to prevent stroke. CADASIL is considered a degenerative disease of adult onset that leads to progressive neurologic deterioration. Onset of symptoms is in the third decade. Migraine, one of its most common manifestations, can develop in childhood. Evaluation for secondary causes is warranted in select pediatric patients who present with atypical migraine, when there is a family history of CADASIL or atypical patterns such as aura without headache, or in the presence of white matter abnormalities. The pathophysiology of CADASIL is poorly understood, and there is no proven effective therapy. Patients require genetic counseling and close follow-up. It is not known if interventions such as antiplatelet therapy are beneficial if instituted early in the course of the disease. Screening of family members at risk for CADASIL, even in the pediatric population, should be considered and offered to patients with CADASIL and their families. CADASIL has rarely been described in the pediatric population. This case report expands our current understanding of the disorder in children.\n",

      "PMID:  14532375\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP), a 37 amino acid peptide identified as the alternately spliced gene product of calcitonin gene, is a sensory neuropeptide with potent cardiovascular effects. CGRP is distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems and possesses diverse biological actions. CGRP has been suggested to play a role in diseases such as migraine, diabetes, pain, and inflammation. Two forms of CGRP (alpha and beta) that differ in three amino acids have been identified and are encoded by different genes. Based on the differential biological activities of various CGRP analogs, the CGRP receptors have been classified into CGRP1 and CGRP2. Structure-activity studies of CGRP analogs showed that the C- and N-terminal regions of the peptide interact independently with their receptors. While C-terminal peptide, CGRP (8-37) behaves as a CGRP1 receptor antagonist, N-terminal peptide CGRP (1-12) behaves as a weak agonist. Structural modifications of CGRP(28-37) have yielded micromolar to nanomolar affinity ligands. CGRP receptor belongs to the calcitonin receptor like receptor (CRLR) family of G-protein-coupled receptors and has been shown to require a single transmembrane domain protein called receptor activity modifying protein-1 (RAMP1) for its functional expression as well as activity. Human, rat, and porcine CRLRs have been cloned and characterized. Currently, the major focus is on the identification of potent and specific nonpeptide antagonists for this receptor in order to understand the physiological and pathophysiological role of this peptide.\n",

      "PMID:  22788114\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and metabolic products of nitric oxide (NO) are increased in jugular venous plasma during migraine attacks and other primary headaches. Patients suffering from primary headaches are particularly sensitive to CGRP and NO donors responding with delayed headaches to an infusion of either of these substances. Accordingly, both CGRP and NO are considered as key mediators in migraine, and clinical trials have shown that inhibitors of CGRP receptors and NO synthase are effective in treating migraine. There is an implicit understanding that CGRP and NO systems interact, and here, we review the body of preclinical work on these systems focusing on the trigeminovascular system in migraine. NO derives from various cell types via 3 isoforms of NO synthase, whereas CGRP is produced from a subset of trigeminal afferents. In rodents, NO donors cause activity alterations on different levels of the trigeminal system including enhancement of CGRP release, which in turn results in arterial vasodilatation and possibly mast cell degranulation in the meninges. The activity of spinal trigeminal neurons, which is a sensitive integrative measure for trigeminal activity, is partly under the control of CGRP and NO. Both mediators facilitate nociceptive transmission, possibly via presynaptic mechanisms. These functions are supported by immunolocalization of CGRP receptor components on 3 trigeminovascular levels: cranial dura mater, trigeminal ganglion, and spinal trigeminal nucleus. Current data support a relationship of CGRP and NO actions on all levels of the trigeminovascular system and emphasize central CGRP receptors as possible therapeutic targets.CI - © 2012 American Headache Society.\n",

      "PMID:  11960817\n",
      "Abs: The familial episodic ataxias are prototypical inherited channelopathies that result in episodes of vertigo and ataxia triggered by stress and exercise. Episodic ataxia type 1 (EA-1) is caused by missense mutations in the potassium channel gene KCNA1, whereas episodic ataxia type 2 (EA-2) is caused by missense and nonsense mutations in the calcium channel gene CACNA1A. These ion channels are crucial for both central and peripheral neurotransmission. Within the last few years, the genetic mechanisms underlying these relatively rare familial episodic ataxia syndromes have been worked out. They provide a model for understanding the mechanisms of more common recurrent vertigo and ataxia syndromes, particularly those associated with migraine. Migraine affects as many as 15-20% of the general population, and it has been estimated that about 25% of patients with migraine experience spontaneous attacks of vertigo and ataxia. We identified 24 families with migraine and benign recurrent vertigo inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. These families have numerous features in common with EA-1 and EA-2 (particularly EA-2), suggesting that benign recurrent vertigo may be an inherited channelopathy. An ion channel mutation shared by brain and inner ear could explain the combined central and peripheral features of the syndrome.\n",

      "PMID:  22971321\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Migraine and other headache disorders affect a large percentage of the population and cause debilitating pain. Activation and sensitization of the trigeminal primary afferent neurons innervating the dura and cerebral vessels is a crucial step in the \"headache circuit\". Many dural afferent neurons respond to algesic and inflammatory agents. Given the clear role of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of channels in both sensing chemical stimulants and mediating inflammatory pain, we investigated the expression of TRP channels in dural afferent neurons. METHODS: We used two fluorescent tracers to retrogradely label dural afferent neurons in adult mice and quantified the abundance of peptidergic and non-peptidergic neuron populations using calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactivity (CGRP-ir) and isolectin B4 (IB4) binding as markers, respectively. Using immunohistochemistry, we compared the expression of TRPV1 and TRPA1 channels in dural afferent neurons with the expression in total trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons. To examine the distribution of TRPM8 channels, we labeled dural afferent neurons in mice expressing farnesylated enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFPf) from a TRPM8 locus. We used nearest-neighbor measurement to predict the spatial association between dural afferent neurons and neurons expressing TRPA1 or TRPM8 channels in the TG. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We report that the size of dural afferent neurons is significantly larger than that of total TG neurons and facial skin afferents. Approximately 40% of dural afferent neurons exhibit IB4 binding. Surprisingly, the percentage of dural afferent neurons containing CGRP-ir is significantly lower than those of total TG neurons and facial skin afferents. Both TRPV1 and TRPA1 channels are expressed in dural afferent neurons. Furthermore, nearest-neighbor measurement indicates that TRPA1-expressing neurons are clustered around a subset of dural afferent neurons. Interestingly, TRPM8-expressing neurons are virtually absent in the dural afferent population, nor do these neurons cluster around dural afferent neurons. Taken together, our results suggest that TRPV1 and TRPA1 but not TRPM8 channels likely contribute to the excitation of dural afferent neurons and the subsequent activation of the headache circuit. These results provide an anatomical basis for understanding further the functional significance of TRP channels in headache pathophysiology.\n",

Genetic variation at the dopamine receptor 2 has been associated with co-morbidity of migraine with aura with major depression and anxiety, and allele D of the angiotensin converting enzyme increases the frequency of migraine without aura attacks. In CDH, analgesic abuse was significantly associated with specific functional polymorphisms at the DRD 4 and at the dopamine transporter (DAT) genes, findings implicating dopamine-related genes in CDH with drug abuse. CDH carries a substantial genetic predisposition. Molecular genetic studies are, however, still few and preliminary.\n",

      "PMID:  23554485\n",
      "Abs: We have identified a new signaling role for nitric oxide (NO) in neurons from the trigeminal ganglia (TG). We show that in rat sensory neurons from the TG the NO donor, S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine, inhibited M-current. This inhibitory effect was blocked by NO scavenging, while inhibition of NO synthases increased M-current, suggesting that tonic NO levels inhibit M-current in TG neurons. Moreover NO increased neuronal excitability and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release and these effects could be prevented by perturbing M-channel function. First, NO-induced depolarization was prevented by pre-application of the M-channel blocker XE991 and second, NO-induced increase in CGRP release was prevented by incubation with the M-channel opener retigabine. We investigated the mechanism of the effects of NO on M-channels and identified a site of action of NO to be the redox modulatory site at the triplet of cysteines within the cytosolic linker between transmembrane domains 2 and 3, which is also a site of oxidative modification of M-channels by reactive oxygen species (ROS). NO and oxidative modifications have opposing effects on M-current, suggesting that a tightly controlled local redox and NO environment will exert fine control over M-channel activity and thus neuronal excitability. Together our data have identified a dynamic redox sensor within neuronal M-channels, which mediates reciprocal regulation of channel activity by NO and ROS. This sensor may play an important role in mediating excitatory effects of NO in such trigeminal disorders as headache and migraine.\n",

      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: To study the molecular genetic and clinical features of cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) in a cohort of Spanish patients. METHODS: We analyzed the CCM1, CCM2, and CCM3 genes by MLPA and direct sequencing of exons and intronic boundaries in 94 familial forms and 41 sporadic cases of CCM patients of Spanish extraction. When available, RNA studies were performed seeking for alternative or cryptic splicing. RESULTS: A total of 26 pathogenic mutations, 22 of which predict truncated proteins, were identified in 29 familial forms and in three sporadic cases. The repertoire includes six novel non-sense and frameshift mutations in CCM1 and CCM3. We also found four missense mutations, one of them located at the third NPXY motif of CCM1 and another one that leads to cryptic splicing of CCM1 exon 6. We found four genomic deletions with the loss of the whole CCM2 gene in one patient and a partial loss of CCM1and CCM2 genes in three other patients. Four families had mutations in CCM3. The results include a high frequency of intronic variants, although most of them localize out of consensus splicing sequences. The main symptoms associated to clinical debut consisted of cerebral haemorrhage, migraines and epileptic seizures. The rare co-occurrence of CCM with Noonan and Chiari syndromes and delayed menarche is reported. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of CCM genes by sequencing and MLPA has detected mutations in almost 35% of a Spanish cohort (36% of familial cases and 10% of sporadic patients). The results include 13 new mutations of CCM genes and the main clinical symptoms that deserves consideration in molecular diagnosis and genetic counselling of cerebral cavernous malformations.\n",

      "PMID:  24998872\n",
      "Abs: The neural mechanism(s) underlying migraine remain poorly defined at present; preclinical and clinical studies show an involvement of CGRP in this disorder. However current evidence pointed out that CGRP does not exert an algogenic action per se, but it is able to mediate migraine pain only if the trigeminal-vascular system is sensitized. The present study was addressed to investigate CGRP-evoked behavior in nitric oxide (NO) sensitized rats, using an experimental model of nitroglycerin induced sensitization of trigeminal system, looking at neuropeptide release from different cerebral areas after the intra-peritoneal (i.p.) administration of NO-donors. CGRP injected into the rat whisker pad did not induce significant changes in face rubbing behavior compared to controls. On the contrary, CGRP injected in animals pre-treated with 10mg/kg nitroglycerin significantly increased the time spent in face rubbing. Nitroglycerin pre-treated animals did not show any rubbing behavior after locally injected saline. Furthermore, the i.p. treatment with nitroglycerin produced an increase of CGRP levels in brainstem and trigeminal ganglia, but not in the hypothalamus and hippocampus. The absolute amounts of CGRP produced in the brainstem were lower compared to those in the trigeminal ganglion; however, after nitroglycerin stimulation the percentage increase was higher in the brainstem. In conclusion, findings presented in this study suggest that CGRP induces a painful behavior in rats only after sensitization of trigeminal system; thus supporting the concept that a genetic as well as acquired predisposition to trigemino- vascular activation represents the neurobiological basis of CGRP nociceptive effects in migraineurs.CI - Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This patient carried a heterozygous Arg182Cys mutation in the Notch3 gene; this mutation was absent in his two biological parents. These data demonstrate the occurrence of a de novo noninherited mutation in the Notch3 gene, which indicates that CADASIL should not be rejected in the absence of a family history.

      "Abs: Little is known of mechanism of dialysis headache (DH). As suggested for migraine, a role for neuropeptides has been investigated. Twenty-four patients under haemodialysis were studied. Twelve of them suffered from DH. The remaining patients were headache free. Blood samples for radioimmunoassay of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP) were collected from the arteriovenous fistula before and after dialysis treatment. Basal plasma concentrations of CGRP were found to be higher in headache patients. Dialysis significantly decreased CGRP concentrations in both groups. No difference in basal plasma concentrations of SP was observed between groups. At the end of the treatment plasma SP concentrations were reduced in headache-free patients but increased in headache patients. Elevated plasma concentrations of CGRP in patients with DH could represent a biochemical factor contributing to susceptibility to headache. Because of the disputable role of SP in migraine, the significance of the increase of the peptide in plasma during DH remains to be elucidated.\n",

These cloning discoveries have also taught us an important general lesson about the molecular pharmacology of G protein-coupled receptor genes: species homologues of a gene (the equivalent gene in different species) may be highly homologous in amino acid sequence yet display very different pharmacological properties. Conversely, two different genes in the same species (intraspecies subtypes) that display only moderate degrees of transmembrane amino acid homology can display nearly indistinguishable pharmacological properties. In discussing the implications of these findings for both 5-HT receptors and G protein-linked receptors in general, Paul Hartig, Theresa Branchek and Richard Weinshank approach the question: why have so many receptor subtypes been preserved in the genome? In addition, controversy has been raging for several years over the classification of 5-HT1B receptors (found only in rat brain) and 5-HT1D receptors. Were they different subtypes or simply species homologues of the same receptor? Recent cloning studies have apparently complicated this issue, but the answer to the question is, in fact, becoming clearer.\n",

      "Title: Lacosamide inhibits calcitonin gene-related peptide production and release at trigeminal level in the rat\n",
      "PMID:  26729049\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Several classes of drugs are effective in prevention and treatment of migraine, although they may differ among each other in their mode of action and in indications. One such class is represented by antiepileptics. Lacosamide is an approved antiepileptic drug that also shows antinociceptive activity in animal models, including analgesic efficacy in central and trigeminal pain. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is considered the main neuro-mediator of trigeminal signalling, playing an essential role in headache, migraine in particular. Here, we investigated the effects of lacosamide on CGRP signalling in both in vitro and ex vivo/vitro models in the rat. METHODS: We assessed: (1) CGRP released from brainstem explants at baseline or after pharmacological challenges; and (2) CGRP levels in brain areas after in vivo treatments with test drugs. RESULTS: We found that: (1) lacosamide inhibits CGRP release from brainstem explants under basal conditions as well as after stimulation by 56 mM KCl, 10 μM veratridine or 1 μM capsaicin; and (2) the i.p. administration of nitroglycerine produces an increase in CGRP levels in the brainstem and trigeminal ganglia, which is inhibited by a pre-treatment with lacosamide. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide preliminary evidence suggesting that lacosamide is able to control pain transmission under conditions affecting the trigeminal system, such as migraine.CI - © 2015 European Pain Federation - EFIC®\n",

      "PMID:  18647185\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore the role of K(ATP) channels in vasodilatation induced by calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), nitric oxide (NO), and transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) in intracranial arteries of rat. BACKGROUND: Dilatation of cerebral and dural arteries causes a throbbing, migraine-like pain. Both CGRP and NO are potent vasodilators that can induce migraine. Their antagonists are effective in the treatment of migraine attacks. K(ATP) channel openers cause headache in the majority of healthy subjects suggesting a role for K(ATP) channels in migraine pathogenesis. We hypothesized that vasodilatation induced by CGRP and the NO donor glyceryltrinitrate (GTN) is mediated via K(ATP) channels. METHODS: We examined the effects of the K(ATP) channel inhibitor glibenclamide on dural and pial vasodilatation induced by CGRP, NO, and endogenously released CGRP by TES. A rat genuine closed cranial window model was used for in vivo studies and myograph baths for studying the effect in vitro. In the closed cranial window model the diameter of dural vessels was measured directly in anesthetized animals to investigate the vascular effects of infused CGRP, NO, and endogenous CGRP after electrical stimulation. Also diameter changes of pial arteries, mean arterial blood pressure and local cerebral blood flow by Laser Doppler flowmetry (LCBF(Flux)) were measured. RESULTS: CGRP, NO, and TES caused dilatation of the 2 arteries in vivo and in vitro. In anesthetized rats glibenclamide significantly attenuated CGRP induced dural and TES induced dural/pial artery dilatation (P = .001; P = .001; P = .005), but had no effect on dural/pial vasodilatation induced by GTN. In vitro glibenclamide failed to significantly inhibit CGRP- and GTN-induced vasodilatation. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that a K(ATP) channel blocker in vivo but not in vitro inhibits CGRP, but not GTN-induced dilatation of dural and pial arteries, a mechanism thought to be important in migraine.\n",

      "PMID:  29976087\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Sildenafil and calcitonin gene-related peptide are vasoactive substances that induce migraine attacks in patients. The intradural arteries are thought to be involved, but these have never been examined in vivo. Sildenafil is the only migraine-inducing compound for which cephalic, extracranial artery dilation is not reported. Here, we investigate the effects of sildenafil and calcitonin gene-related peptide on the extracranial and intradural parts of the middle meningeal artery. METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, three-way crossover, placebo-controlled head-to-head comparison study, MR-angiography was recorded in healthy volunteers at baseline and twice after study drug (sildenafil/ calcitonin gene-related peptide/saline) administration. Circumferences of extracranial and intradural middle meningeal artery segments were measured using semi-automated analysis software. The area under the curve for circumference change was compared using paired t-tests between study days. RESULTS: Twelve healthy volunteers completed the study. The area under the curve(Baseline-120min) was significantly larger on both the sildenafil and the calcitonin gene-related peptide day in the intradural middle meningeal artery (calcitonin gene-related peptide, p = 0.013; sildenafil, p = 0.027) and the extracranial middle meningeal artery (calcitonin gene-related peptide, p = 0.0003; sildenafil, p = 0.021), compared to placebo. Peak intradural middle meningeal artery dilation was 9.9% (95% CI [2.9-16.9]) after sildenafil (T(30min)) and 12.5% (95% CI [8.1-16.8]) after calcitonin gene-related peptide (T(30min)). Peak dilation of the extracranial middle meningeal artery after calcitonin gene-related peptide (T(30min)) was 15.7% (95% CI [11.2-20.1]) and 18.9% (95% CI [12.8-24.9]) after sildenafil (T(120min)). CONCLUSION: An important novel finding is that both sildenafil and calcitonin gene-related peptide dilate intradural arteries, supporting the notion that all known pharmacological migraine triggers dilate cephalic vessels. We suggest that intradural artery dilation is associated with headache induced by calcitonin gene-related peptide and sildenafil.\n",

      "Title: Voltage-dependent calcium channels are involved in neurogenic dural vasodilatation via a presynaptic transmitter release mechanism\n",
      "PMID:  12970082\n",
      "Abs: Amissense mutation of the CACNA1A gene that encodes the alpha1A subunit of the voltage-dependent P/Q-type calcium channel has been discovered in patients suffering from familial hemiplegic migraine. This suggested that calcium channelopathies may be involved in migraine more broadly, and established the importance of genetic mechanisms in migraine. Channelopathies share many clinical characteristics with migraine, and thus exploring calcium channel functions in the trigeminovascular system may give insights into migraine pathophysiology. It is also known that drugs blocking the P/Q- and N-type calcium channels have been successful in other animal models of trigeminovascular activation and head pain. In the present study, we used intravital microscopy to examine the effects of specific calcium channel blockers on neurogenic dural vasodilatation and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-induced dilation. The L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel blocker calciseptine significantly attenuated (20 microg kg(-1), n=7) the dilation brought about by electrical stimulation, but did not effect CGRP-induced dural dilation. The P/Q-type voltage-dependent calcium channel blocker omega-agatoxin-IVA (20 microg kg-1, n=7) significantly attenuated the dilation brought about by electrical stimulation, but did not effect CGRP-induced dural dilation. The N-type voltage-dependent calcium channel blocker omega-conotoxin-GVIA (20 microg kg(-1), n=8 and 40 microg kg(-1), n=7) significantly attenuated the dilation brought about by electrical stimulation, but did not effect CGRP-induced dural dilation. It is thought that the P/Q-, N- and L-type calcium channels all exist presynaptically on trigeminovascular neurons, and blockade of these channels prevents CGRP release, and, therefore, dural blood vessel dilation. These data suggest that the P/Q-, N- and L-type calcium channels may be involved in trigeminovascular nociception.\n",

It is based on the observation that genes that reside physically close on a chromosome remain linked during meiosis. For most neurologic diseases for which the underlying biochemical defect was not known, the identification of the chromosomal location of the disease gene was the first step in its eventual isolation. By now, genes that have been isolated in this way include examples from all types of neurologic diseases, from neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, or ataxias, to diseases of ion channels leading to periodic paralysis or hemiplegic migraine, to tumor syndromes such as neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2.\n",

      "Abs: Prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) is considered to be a key mediator in migraine pathophysiology. PGE(2) acts via four receptors (EP(1)-EP(4)) but their distribution in the brain districts implicated in migraine has yet to be delineated. We quantified amount of mRNA and protein expression for the EP receptors in both peripheral and central structures involved in pain transmission and perception in migraine: dura mater, cerebral arteries, trigeminal ganglion, trigeminal nucleus caudalis, periaqueductal grey, thalamus, hypothalamus, cortex, pituitary gland, hippocampus and cerebellum. In the trigeminal-vascular system (TVS) we found highest expression of EP(1) and EP(2) protein in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. EP(3) and EP(4) mRNA expression were highest in the trigeminal ganglion. Within intracranial structures EP(1) mRNA and protein expression were significantly higher in pituitary gland and cerebellum than in dorsal root ganglia (peripheral control), whereas the EP(2) mRNA and protein were highly abundant in the pituitary gland. EP(3) mRNA was mainly found in thalamus and hypothalamus. The most robust mRNA and protein expression for EP(4) receptor was seen in the dorsal root ganglion. In conclusion, all four receptors are located in areas implicated in migraine supporting the possible involvement of PGE(2) in this disease.CI - Copyright © 2011.

      "PMID:  30151722\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a promiscuous peptide, similar to many other members of the calcitonin family of peptides. The potential of CGRP to act on many different receptors with differing affinities and efficacies makes deciphering the signalling from the CGRP receptor a challenging task for researchers.Although it is not a typical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), in that it is composed not just of a GPCR, the CGRP receptor activates many of the same signalling pathways common for other GPCRs. This includes the family of G proteins and a variety of protein kinases and transcription factors. It is now also clear that in addition to the initiation of cell-surface signalling, GPCRs, including the CGRP receptor, also activate distinct signalling pathways as the receptor is trafficking along the endocytic conduit.Given CGRP's characteristic of activating multiple GPCRs, we will first consider the complex of calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) as the CGRP receptor. We will discuss the discovery of the CGRP receptor components, the molecular mechanisms controlling its internalization and post-endocytic trafficking (recycling and degradation) and the diverse signalling cascades that are elicited by this receptor in model cell lines. We will then discuss CGRP-mediated signalling pathways in primary cells pertinent to migraine including neurons, glial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells.Investigation of all the CGRP- and CGRP receptor-mediated signalling cascades is vital if we are to fully understand CGRP's role in migraine and will no doubt unearth new targets for the treatment of migraine and other CGRP-driven diseases.\n",

His mother, who had the same point mutation, also had migraine but without myoclonus or ataxia. His aunt, who had the same point mutation and migraine, developed diabetes mellitus, encephalomyopathy and several stroke-like episodes associated with lactic acidosis (MELAS). This is the third family with the rare mutation seen in American and Italian families.

      "PMID:  28165287\n",
      "Abs: Background Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a neuropeptide that acts in the trigeminovascular system and is believed to play an important role in migraine. CGRP activates two receptors that are both present in the trigeminovascular system; the CGRP receptor and the amylin 1 (AMY(1)) receptor. CGRP receptor antagonists, including olcegepant (BIBN4096BS) and telcagepant (MK-0974), can treat migraine. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of these antagonists at blocking CGRP receptor signalling in trigeminal ganglia (TG) neurons and transfected CGRP and AMY(1) receptors in Cos7 cells, to better understand their mechanism of action. Methods CGRP stimulation of four intracellular signalling molecules relevant to pain (cAMP, CREB, p38 and ERK) were examined in rat TG neurons and compared to transfected CGRP and AMY(1) receptors in Cos7 cells. Results In TG neurons, olcegepant displayed signal-specific differences in antagonism of CGRP responses. This effect was also evident in transfected Cos7 cells, where olcegepant blocked CREB phosphorylation more potently than expected at the AMY(1) receptor, suggesting that the affinity of this antagonist can be dependent on the signalling pathway activated. Conclusions CGRP receptor antagonist activity appears to be assay-dependent. Thus, these molecules may not be as selective for the CGRP receptor as commonly reported.\n",

      "PMID:  31284729\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Migraine is associated with activation of the trigeminovascular system, release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and dilation of dural arteries. Novel treatments target calcitonin gene-related peptide or its receptor, which are present in all vascular beds, raising cardiovascular concerns. Erenumab is a human CGRP-receptor antibody approved for the prophylactic treatment of migraine. METHODS: We characterised the relaxant responses to CGRP in the absence and presence of erenumab (1 μM) in isolated human middle meningeal, internal mammary and (proximal and distal) coronary arteries. Furthermore, in human internal mammary arteries from cardiovascularly-compromised patients, we assessed the pharmacological specificity of erenumab by investigating whether the vasodilatory responses to acetylcholine, sodium nitroprusside, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP), vasoactive intestinal peptide and nicardipine, along with the vasoconstrictor responses to dihydroergotamine, were modified by erenumab. RESULTS: Calcitonin gene-related peptide induced concentration-dependent vasodilatory responses in all vessels studied that were significantly antagonised by erenumab. In human internal mammary arteries from cardiovascularly-compromised patients, the responses to acetylcholine, sodium nitroprusside, PACAP, vasoactive intestinal peptide, nicardipine and dihydroergotamine were unaffected by erenumab. CONCLUSION: Erenumab inhibits calcitonin gene-related peptide-induced vasodilatory responses in human middle meningeal arteries, human internal mammary arteries and human coronary arteries. Moreover, erenumab shows functional specificity as no interaction was observed with the relaxant responses to several vasodilators, nor the dihydroergotamine-dependent vasoconstrictor responses.\n",

      "PMID:  31207980\n",
      "Abs: Chuanxiong Rhizoma and Cyperi Rhizoma (CRCR), an ancient and classic formula comprised of Chuanxiong Rhizoma and Cyperi Rhizoma in a weight ratio of 1:2, has long been used for curing migraine. This study aimed to explore their anti-migraine effect and active constituents. A nitroglycerin (NTG)-induced migraine model in rats was established to evaluate pharmacological effects. Cerebral blood flow was detected by a laser Doppler perfusion monitor. The levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), nitric oxide (NO), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 5-hydoxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and β-endorphin (β-EP) were quantified with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. CGRP and c-Fos mRNA expression were quantified with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. A UPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification of active constituents in rat serum and cerebral cortex. CRCR significantly increased cerebral blood flow, decreased the levels of ET-1, GABA and NOS, and increased the levels of 5-HT, 5-HIAA and β-EP in NTG-induced migraine rats. CGRP levels and CGRP mRNA expression, as well as c-Fos mRNA expression in the brainstem were markedly down-regulated with the treatment of CRCR. After oral administration of CRCR, ferulic acid (FA), senkyunolide A (SA), 3-n-butylphthalide (NBP), Z-ligustilide (LIG), Z-3-butylidenephthalide (BDPH), cyperotundone (CYT), nookatone (NKT) and α-cyperone (CYP) were qualified in rat serum and cerebral cortex. The above results suggested that CRCR showed powerfully therapeutic effects on migraine via increasing the cerebral blood flow, decreasing the expression of CGRP and c-Fos mRNA, and regulating the releasing of ET-1, GABA, NOS, 5-HT, 5-HIAA, CGRP and β-EP in the serum and brainstem, consequently relieving neurogenic inflammation. The active constituents in CRCR for treating migraine were FA, SA, NBP, LIG, BDPH, CYT, NKT and CYP. These findings contributed for the further use of CRCR as a combinational and complementary phytomedicine for migraine treatment.\n",

      "Abs: OBJECTIVES: To elucidate possible genetic factors involved in the pathogenesis of primary Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) and to determine the demographic features. METHODS: The allele frequencies of known polymorphisms in four vasoactive candidate genes, eNOS, BKRG, ET-1 and the ETA receptor genes, were compared in a phenotypically homogeneous group of patients with primary RP and a normal control population. RESULTS: In patients with primary RP, there was a higher reporting of both a family history of RP than in controls (45.3% vs 3.1%; P<0.0001) and a personal history of migraine (32.6% vs 7.2%; P<0.0001). No significant differences in allele frequencies of the candidate genes were found. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the concept that genetic susceptibility exists in primary RP. The high prevalence of migraine suggests that primary RP is part of a more widespread disorder of vascular tone. These findings do not suggest that common molecular variants of these candidate genes are involved in primary RP.\n",

      "PMID:  15636014\n",
      "Abs: Chronic orofacial pain syndromes are produced by nerve injury, diseases, and toxins. They constitute an unsolved medical problem because they affect a considerable number of adults and are difficult to treat. There is a remarkable variability among adults in terms of susceptibility to chronic orofacial pain and its characteristics, which suggests that these syndromes are complex heritable traits controlled by alleles of certain polymorphic genes that interact with the environment. Each syndrome is assumed to be determined by a unique set of genes. In the present report, a practical study design is proposed to identify the genes responsible for interindividual variability in orofacial pain levels. This design is based on research strategies that have been used for studying other human diseases as well as pain syndromes outside the orofacial region. Specifically, this design has been used successfully by the authors and others over the past 8 years to study chronic pain syndromes such as migraines, radiculopathy, amputation pain, and postmastectomy pain. The strategies used to study these topics have been adapted to address the unique problems of orofacial pain. The authors believe that the study of genetics provides a novel research approach from which to identify targets for the development of individually tailored approaches in orofacial pain medicine, such as diagnostic and prognostic kits and novel drugs that would prevent pain chronicity in susceptible individuals or alleviate it once it had developed. This report focuses on human models. A follow-up report is intended to extend this design into animal models of orofacial pain syndromes.\n",

      "Abs: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is caused by mutations in the Notch3 gene on chromosome 19. The condition manifests itself clinically typically in the third to fifth decade with migraine and recurrent episodes of stroke or transient ischaemic attacks. We report the case of an 11-year-old male with CADASIL resulting in stroke with right hemiparesis and dysphasia. Acute magnetic resonance imaging suggested infarction in the left hemisphere; magnetic resonance angiography revealed calibre variation of the intracerebral arteries. The patient suffered from common migraine with five to six attacks per month for 3 years 6 months before the stroke. Attacks occurred early in the morning with severe one-sided headache, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting. Antimigraine medications had no effect. The family history revealed more cases of CADASIL, with an autosomal dominant pattern. The diagnosis of CADASIL was confirmed by the finding of the known mutation of the Notch3 gene running in the family. With treatment in a neurorehabilitation centre the patient recovered most of his functions with only discrete fine-motor and cognitive sequelae. Our case report highlights the need for paediatricians to consider CADASIL in childhood stroke as well as in migraine patients.\n",

      "Abs: Ethanol stimulating transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) on primary sensory neurons promotes neurogenic inflammation, including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-mediated coronary dilation. Alcoholic beverages trigger migraine attacks and activation of trigeminal neurons plays a role in migraine. We have investigated in guinea pigs whether ethanol by TRPV1 stimulation causes neurogenic inflammation in the trigeminovascular system. Ethanol-evoked release of neuropeptides from slices of dura mater was abolished by Ca(2+) removal, capsaicin pretreatment and the TRPV1 antagonist, capsazepine. Intragastric ethanol increased plasma extravasation in dura mater, an effect abolished by capsazepine and the NK1 receptor antagonist, SR140333, and caused vasodilation around the middle meningeal artery, an effect abolished by capsazepine and the CGRP receptor antagonist, BIBN4096BS. Vasodilation of meningeal vessels by TRPV1 activation and CGRP release may be relevant to the mechanism by which alcohol ingestion triggers migraine attacks.\n",

      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: To perform linkage analysis between the Short Tandem Repeats (STR) microsatellite markers D19S923, D19S929, D19S22, which are in strong genetic linkage to Notch3 gene in order to contrast the hypothesis that the vascular hereditary dementia phenotype described in a multigenerational extended pedigree from Colombia correspond to CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy). Even we know that using techniques as the Single Strand Conformational Polymorphisms (SSCP) could determine mutations in Notch3, the rationality of this approach is that intronic variations could not be defined and that we are interested in determine if some forms of the clinical presentation and its phenotypic variability make part of CADASIL. INTRODUCTION: The CADASIL phenotype is caused by mutations in the Notch3 gene. Clinical features of CADASIL are: 1. Recurrent cerebra-vascular episodes; 2. Migraine history; 3. History of transitory ischemic attack and, 4. Behavior changes and dementia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: By using SIMLINK we showed that the extended genealogy had the enough power to detect significant LOD (logarithm of oods) score values when Notch3 was considered the disorder cause. Linkage analysis was carried out by using parametric and non parametrical methods. The Elston-Stewart general method was used as the parametrical analysis and the sib pair method as the non-parametrical one. We perform simulations changing the affection status codification by including as affected or not including those individuals with migraine. Furthermore, in order to detect the stability of the results, we changed the penetrance values, the genetic frequencies on both, the marker loci and the affection locus. RESULTS: The maximum pair-wise LOD score was 2.04 which was detected at the marker D19S23 with q= 0.11cM. This distance correspond exactly with the Notch3 location. That is 100 times more probable that there is linkage that there is not. In other words this probability could be explained as if the phenotype correspond to CADASIL than to other vascular dementia. The non parametric results were compatibles with the parametric ones. When the migraine symptom was considered as a part of the affected status, the LOD score values showed not linkage. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the linkage analysis to these STR microsatellite markers suggest that the vascular hereditary dementia phenotype described in this family correspond to CADASIL caused by a polymorphism on the Notch3 gene. On the contrary, these same results suggest that the migraine phenotype is not a part of the progressive dementia.\n",

      "Abs: The introduction of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) or CGRP receptors in the treatment of migraine raised concerns on the possible risks associated to the long-term inhibition of CGRP physiological functions. In this proof-of-concept study, we have measured the circulating levels of CGRP in 7 patients with high-frequency episodic migraine receiving the anti-CGRP receptor mAb erenumab for at least 6 months, to test the hypothesis that long-term blockade of CGRP receptors induces an increase in systemic CGRP levels via a classical up-regulation mechanism.Plasma CGRP levels were measured by a validated radioimmunoassay at baseline, and after 1 and 6 months of treatment with erenumab, 70 mg given sc every 4 weeks.We found (data expressed as the means ± SD): 38.34 ± 30.74 pg CGRP/ml of plasma at baseline, 38.19 ± 29.23 pg/ml after 1 month and 53.89 ± 28.03 pg/ml after 6 months of treatment. Thus, the average increase in plasma CGRP levels after 6 months of treatment was about + 40% compared to both baseline and 1-month treatments; such difference was not statistically significant because of high SD values in all groups.These preliminary findings need to be confirmed in larger, sufficiently powered experiments.\n",

      "PMID:  8905706\n",
      "Abs: The possible presynaptic action of the anti-migraine drug sumatriptan on primary afferent fibres containing substance P and/or calcitonin gene-related peptide was investigated on superfused rat horizontal spinal cord slices with attached dorsal roots. Electrical stimulation of dorsal roots triggered a significant overflow of both peptides; this could be reduced by sumatriptan in a concentration-dependent manner. As expected from the involvement of 5-HT1B/1.D beta receptors, methiothepin, (-)tertatolol and GR 127,935, but not WAY 100,635, prevented the inhibitors effect of sumatriptan. These data support the idea that the anti-migraine action of sumatriptan may involve, at least in part, a presynaptic inhibitory control of nociceptive (trigeminovascular) substance P- and/or calcitonin gene-related peptide-containing sensory fibres.\n",

      "PMID:  24024603\n",
      "Abs: Botulinum toxin, a potent muscle relaxant, has been found to have analgesic effects in patients with various pain syndromes. Both in vitro and in vivo studies showed the ability of the toxin to block the release of pain neurotransmitters, such as substance P, glutamate, and calcitonin gene-related peptide. The effect of the toxin, and specifically of one of its serotypes, botulinum neurotoxin type A, on headaches, has been extensively studied. This serotype is available in the United States in 3 forms, including as onabotulinumtoxinA. Data from clinical trials confirmed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of onabotulinumtoxinA in the prophylactic treatment of chronic migraine, the most severe and debilitating type of migraine, in adults. The drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for this indication in 2010. The drug was not found to be effective for episodic migraine or tension-type headache. Noncontrolled studies suggest the efficacy of the toxin for headache associated with craniocervical dystonia. Proper injection technique and appropriate patient selection are essential for achieving positive results after treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA. The recommended injection paradigm combines a fixed site/fixed dose and follow the pain approaches, with the toxin injected to multiple sites of the head and neck, at a total dose of 155U-195U. The treatment is given at intervals of 12 weeks on average. The efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA for some headaches, its long duration of action, and its favorable adverse effect profile make it a viable treatment option for the appropriate headache patients. The drug may be particularly suitable for patients who cannot tolerate, or are not compliant with, the daily intake of oral headache preventive drugs.CI - © 2013 American Headache Society.\n",

      "Abs: BACKGROUND/AIMS: Migraine is a disabling condition that severely impacts socioeconomic function and quality of life. The focus of this study was to develop a mouse model of trigeminal pain that mimics migraine. METHODS: After undergoing dural cannulation surgery, mice were treated with repeated dural doses of an acidic solution to induce trigeminal pain. RESULTS: The method elicited intermittent, head-directed wiping and scratching as well as the expression of both the c-FOS gene in the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) in the periaqueductal grey matter. Interestingly, the acid-induced trigeminal pain behaviour was inhibited by amiloride, an antagonist of acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), but not by AMG-9810, an inhibitor of transient receptor potential cation channel V1(TRPV1). In addition, the relative mRNA and protein expression levels of ASIC1a and ASIC3 were increased in the acid-induced trigeminal nociceptive pathways. Furthermore, blocking CaMKII with KN-93 significantly reduced the acid-induced trigeminal pain behaviour and c-FOS gene expression. CONCLUSION: The data suggested that chronic intermittent administration of an acidic solution to mice resulted in trigeminal hypersensitivity and that dural acid-induced trigeminal pain behaviour in mice may mechanistically mimic migraine. The observations here identify an entirely novel treatment strategy for migraine.CI - © 2018 The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.\n",

      "Title: Selective Inhibition of Trigeminovascular Neurons by Fremanezumab: A Humanized Monoclonal Anti-CGRP Antibody\n",
      "PMID:  28642283\n",
      "Abs: A large body of evidence supports an important role for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in migraine pathophysiology. This evidence gave rise to a global effort to develop a new generation of therapeutics that inhibit the interaction of CGRP with its receptor in migraineurs. Recently, a new class of such drugs, humanized anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (CGRP-mAbs), were found to be effective in reducing the frequency of migraine. The purpose of this study was to better understand how the CGRP-mAb fremanezumab (TEV-48125) modulates meningeal sensory pathways. To answer this question, we used single-unit recording to determine the effects of fremanezumab (30 mg/kg, IV) and its isotype control Ab on spontaneous and evoked activity in naive and cortical spreading depression (CSD)-sensitized trigeminovascular neurons in the spinal trigeminal nucleus of anesthetized male and female rats. The study demonstrates that, in both sexes, fremanezumab inhibited naive high-threshold (HT) neurons, but not wide-dynamic range trigeminovascular neurons, and that the inhibitory effects on the neurons were limited to their activation from the intracranial dura but not facial skin or cornea. In addition, when given sufficient time, fremanezumab prevents the activation and sensitization of HT neurons by CSD. Mechanistically, these findings suggest that HT neurons play a critical role in the initiation of the perception of headache and the development of cutaneous allodynia and central sensitization. Clinically, the findings may help to explain the therapeutic benefit of CGRP-mAb in reducing headaches of intracranial origin such as migraine with aura and why this therapeutic approach may not be effective for every migraine patient.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibodies (CGRP-mAbs) are capable of preventing migraine. However, their mechanism of action is unknown. In the current study, we show that, if given enough time, a CGRP-mAb can prevent the activation and sensitization of high-threshold (central) trigeminovascular neurons by cortical spreading depression, but not their activation from the skin or cornea, suggesting a potential explanation for selectivity to migraine headache, but not other pains, and a predominantly peripheral site of action.CI - Copyright © 2017 the authors 0270-6474/17/377149-15$15.00/0.\n",

      "Title: Dural vasodilation causes a sensitization of rat caudal trigeminal neurones in vivo that is blocked by a 5-HT1B/1D agonist\n",
      "PMID:  10217543\n",
      "Abs: 1. Migraine headache pain is thought to result from an abnormal distention of intracranial, extracerebral blood vessels and the consequent activation of the trigeminal nervous system. Migraine is also often accompanied by extracranial sensory disturbances from facial tissues. These experiments investigate whether meningeal dilation produces central sensitization of neurones that receive convergent input from the face. 2. Single unit extracellular activity was recorded from the trigeminal nucleus caudalis of anaesthetized rats in response to either noxious stimulation of the dura mater, innocuous stimulation of the vibrissae or to a transient dilation of the meningeal vascular bed. 3. Rat alpha-CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide; 1 microg kg(-1), i.v.) caused a dilation of the middle meningeal artery and facilitated vibrissal responses by 36+/-7%. 4. The 5-HT1B/1D agonist, L-741,604 (3 mg kg(-1), i.v.), inhibited responses to noxious stimulation of the dura mater (16+/-7% of control) and, in a separate group of animals, blocked the CGRP-evoked facilitation of vibrissal responses. 5. L-741,604 (3 mg kg(-1), i.v.) also inhibited responses to innocuous stimulation of the vibrissa (14+/-10% of control) with neurones that received convergent input from the face and from the dura mater, but not with cells that received input only from the face (70+/-12% of control). 6. These data show that dilation of meningeal blood vessels causes a sensitization of central trigeminal neurones and a facilitation of facial sensory processing which was blocked by activation of pre-synaptic 5-HT1B/1D receptors. 7. Sustained dural blood vessel dilation during migraine may cause a sensitization of trigeminal neurones. This may underlie some of the symptoms of migraine, such as the headache pain and the extracranial allodynia. Inhibition of this central sensitization may therefore offer a novel strategy for the development of acute and/or prophylactic anti-migraine therapies.\n",

      "PMID:  15265049\n",
      "Abs: In primary headaches, there is a clear association between the headache and the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) but not with any of the other neuronal messengers. The purpose of this review is to describe the role of CGRP in the intracranial circulation and to elucidate a possible role for a specific CGRP receptor antagonist in the treatment of primary headaches. Acute treatment with a 5-HT(1B/1D) agonist (triptan) results in alleviation of the headache and normalization of the cranial venous CGRP levels, in part due to a presynaptic inhibitory effect on sensory nerves. The central role of CGRP in migraine and cluster headache pathophysiology has led to the search for small molecule CGRP antagonists with few cardiovascular side-effects. The initial pharmacological profile of such a group of compounds has recently been disclosed. One of these compounds has been found to be efficacious in the relief of acute attacks of migraine.\n",

      "PMID:  7928323\n",
      "Abs: Migraine headache involves the activation of trigeminal afferents that are predominantly found in the first or ophthalmic division of the nerve. The headache is often pounding and the connections of the trigeminal nerve, the trigeminovascular system, have therefore been implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine and studied extensively. Considerable attention has been given to the peripheral ramifications of the system as a possible locus of action for anti-migraine drugs while little attention has been focused upon possible central sites of action. It has been shown that certain peptides can act as markers for the trigeminal system, in particular calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and that CGRP is elevated in migraine. We have employed an animal model for activation of the trigeminovascular system to evaluate a new antimigraine compound, 311C90, that may have central and as well as peripheral trigeminal actions. Cats were anesthetized by halothane induction and alpha-chloralose maintenance (60 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), intubated, paralyzed and ventilated. Biparietal craniotomies were carried out to measure cerebral blood flow using laser Doppler flowmetry (CBFLDF). The external jugular vein was cannulated and blood drawn, centrifuged and frozen until processing. Stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion resulted in a mean maximum increase in CBFLDF of 39 +/- 5% at 20/s. The 5HT1 agonist 311C90 was administered intravenously in two doses (30 and 100 micrograms/kg) to cover the range of doses likely to be effective clinically. At each dose the CBFLDF effect of trigeminal ganglion stimulation was inhibited.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "Title: Topiramate inhibits trigeminovascular activation: an intravital microscopy study\n",
      "PMID:  15980877\n",
      "Abs: Activation, or the altered perception of activation, of trigeminal nerves that innervate the cranial vasculature is considered to be a pivotal component of the pathophysiology of acute migraine. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) levels are increased during migraine and after trigeminal nerve stimulation in the cat. Both CGRP and nitric oxide (NO) infusion causes headache and delayed migraine in migraineurs. Neurogenic stimulation of a cranial window, CGRP and NO injection all cause meningeal artery dilation in the rat when viewed using intravital microscopy. Topiramate is an antiepileptic drug with established efficacy as a migraine preventive, and has recently been shown to inhibit neurons of the trigeminocervical complex after superior sagittal sinus stimulation. In this study, we used intravital microscopy with neurogenic dural vasodilation, and CGRP- and NO-induced dilation to examine whether intravenous topiramate has effects on the trigeminovascular system. Topiramate was able to attentuate neurogenic dural vasodilation maximally after 15 min by 52% at 30 mg kg(-1) (t(5) = 6.78, n = 6); there was no significant inhibition at 10 mg kg(-1). There was also significant attenuation of the NO-induced dilation maximally after 15 min, at both 10 and 30 mg kg(-1) by 21% (t(6) = 6.09, n = 7) and 41% (t(6) = 5.3, n = 7), respectively. CGRP-induced dilation was not inhibited at either dose of topiramate. The study demonstrates that topiramate is likely to inhibit neurogenic dural vasodilation by inhibiting the release of CGRP from prejunctional trigeminal neurons, thus attenuating the dural vasodilation. Topiramate is not able to act postsynaptically at the blood vessels themselves as the CGRP-induced dilation was not attenuated. The data are consistent with an effect of topiramate on trigeminovascular activation which may form part of its preventive antimigraine mechanisms of action.\n",

      "PMID:  19329451\n",
      "Abs: While effective therapies are available for some types of craniofacial pain, treatments for deep-tissue craniofacial pain such as temporomandibular disorders are less efficacious. Several ion channels and receptors which are prominent in craniofacial nociceptive mechanisms have been identified on trigeminal primary afferent neurons. Many of these receptors and channels exhibit unusual distributions compared with extracranial regions. For example, expression of the ATP receptor P2X(3) is strongly implicated in nociception and is more abundant on trigeminal primary afferent neurons than analogous extracranial neurons, making them potentially productive targets specifically for craniofacial pain therapies. The initial part of this review therefore focuses on P2X(3) as a potential therapeutic target to treat deep-tissue craniofacial pain. In the trigeminal ganglion, P2X(3) receptors are often co-expressed with the nociceptive neuropeptides CGRP and SP. Therefore, we discuss the role of CGRP and SP in deep-tissue craniofacial pain and suggest that neuropeptide antagonists, which have shown promise for the treatment of migraine, may have wider therapeutic potential, including the treatment of deep-tissue craniofacial pain. P2X(3), TRPV1, and ASIC3 are often co-expressed in trigeminal neurons, implying the formation of functional complexes that allow craniofacial nociceptive neurons to respond synergistically to altered ATP and pH in pain. Future therapeutics for craniofacial pain thus might be more efficacious if targeted at combinations of P2X(3), CGRP, TRPV1, and ASIC3.\n",

      "PMID:  16942474\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: The goal of the proposed research was to determine the effect of topiramate on basal and stimulated release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from trigeminal ganglia neurons. BACKGROUND: CGRP is implicated in migraine headaches. Clinical evidence supports topiramate as an effective migraine prophylactic. In this study, the connection between topiramate and CGRP expression was investigated. METHODS: Primary cultures of rat trigeminal ganglia were utilized to determine the effects of topiramate on CGRP release stimulated by a depolarizing stimulus (KCl), nitric oxide, and/or protons. The amount of CGRP secreted into the culture media was determined using a CGRP-specific radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: Treatment of trigeminal cultures with KCl, nitric oxide donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, or protons (pH 5.5 media) caused a marked increase (3 to 5 fold) in the amount of CGRP release. Topiramate treatment repressed KCl-stimulated CGRP release in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. However, topiramate did not alter the amount of unstimulated or basal CGRP released from trigeminal neurons. In addition, topiramate inhibited nitric oxide and proton mediated CGRP secretion. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from these studies demonstrate that topiramate can directly repress the stimulated release of CGRP from sensory trigeminal neurons. We propose that topiramate's ability to prevent migraine attacks may involve inhibition of CGRP secretion from trigeminal neurons.\n",

      "Abs: Background and Objectives: Previous studies found differences in the characteristics of NOTCH3 mutations in Caucasians and Asians with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). Therefore, we sought to investigate the correlations between genetic and clinical/radiological findings in Korean CADASIL patients including some variants of unknown significance (VUS). Materials and Methods: We screened 198 patients with a suspected diagnosis of CADASIL between 2005 and 2015 via Sanger sequencing. Results: A total of 34 subjects (52.5 ± 9.5 years) were included. The majority of the mutations were in exon 3 and exon 11. R75P mutations (n = 5), followed by Y465C and R544C mutations (n = 4) were the most prevalent. Patients with those mutations exhibited less frequent anterior temporal (AT) or external capsular (EC) hyperintensities compared to patients with other locus mutations. Hemorrhagic stroke (HS) was found to be associated with mutations in exon 3 (R75P), exon 9 (Y465C), exon 11 (R587C), and exon 22 (R1175W variants), which were common locations in our study. Although it is unclear that genetic differences might affect the phenotypes in ethnicities, Asian population shows less migraine or seizure, but more intracerebral hemorrhage. Unlike in westernized countries, typical AT or EC hyperintensities may not be significant MRI markers, at least in Korean CADASIL patients. Furthermore, similar to R75P phenotypes, it is a novel finding that patients with Y465C and R1175W VUS have less frequent AT involvement than Caucasians. Conclusion: The associations between HS and common genetic locations account for the increased development of intracerebral hemorrhage in Koreans rather than Caucasians. We suggest that some CADASIL mutations appear to impart novel region-specific characteristics.\n",

      "PMID:  31366221\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a neuronal transmitter present in intracranial sensory nerves, where it is involved in migraine pathophysiology as well as other biological functions. Recently, the fully human monoclonal antibody erenumab (AMG 334), which targets the canonical calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, showed significant prophylactic efficacy and favourable safety in phase II and III clinical trials for episodic and chronic migraine and is now approved for migraine prevention in several countries. OBJECTIVE: Given that calcitonin gene-related peptide can mediate vasodilation, we investigated the effect of erenumab on vasoactive responses in the presence or absence of various vasodilatory and vasocontractile mediators in a model using isolated human cerebral and meningeal arteries. METHODS: Ring segments of human isolated cerebral and meningeal arteries were mounted in a sensitive myograph. On arterial segments pre-contracted with 30 mM potassium chloride, vasoactive responses to calcitonin gene-related peptide were studied in the presence of different concentrations of erenumab. At the maximal tested inhibitory concentration of erenumab (100 nM), functional arterial relaxation in response to nicardipine or substance P, and the contractile responses to sumatriptan and dihydroergotamine were examined. RESULTS: 30 mM potassium chloride produced a stable contraction of the vessel segments and calcitonin gene-related peptide induced a concentration-dependent relaxation. We observed that (i) erenumab had no direct contractile or relaxant effects per se (by itself), (ii) pre-treatment with erenumab antagonized the calcitonin gene-related peptide-induced relaxation in a competitive manner, (iii) the relaxant responses to nicardipine or substance P were unaffected in the presence of erenumab and (iv) the contraction induced by sumatriptan or dihydroergotamine was not modified by erenumab. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that erenumab, while not associated with vasoactive properties per se, specifically inhibits calcitonin gene-related peptide-induced relaxation of cranial arteries without impacting vasodilatory responses or contractile responses of endogenous or pharmacological vasoactive compounds.\n",

      "PMID:  17059437\n",
      "Abs: We have previously shown that nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) may cause headache and migraine. However, not all findings in previous studies can be explained by an activation of the NO-cGMP pathway. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) causes headache and migraine in migraine patients, but CGRP receptor activation causes an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). In order to investigate the role of cAMP in vascular headache pathogenesis, we studied the effect of cilostazol, an inhibitor of cAMP degradation, in our human experimental headache model. Twelve healthy volunteers were included in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study. Placebo or cilostazol (200 mg p.o.) was administered on two separate study days. Headache was scored on a verbal rating scale (0-10) and mechanical pain thresholds were measured with von Frey hairs. The median peak headache score 0-16 h postdose was 0 (range 0-2) after placebo and 3.5 (range 0-7) after cilostazol (P = 0.003). The median headache curve peaked at 6-9 h postdose. The headaches induced were usually bilateral and pulsating. Nausea occurred in two volunteers, photo- and phonophobia were not seen. Two volunteers had a headache that fulfilled International Headache Society criteria for migraine without aura after cilostazol. No change in mechanical pain thresholds in the forehead was seen (P = 0.25). The headache after cilostazol was equal to or more severe than headache induced by glyceryl trinitrate in previous experiments. The present study thus indicates that increased levels of cAMP may play a role in headache and migraine pathogenesis.\n",

      "PMID:  18592477\n",
      "Abs: INTRODUCTION: Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies belong to a heterogeneous group of diseases with a range of neurological symptoms caused by a dysfunction somewhere in the nervous system. They may arise from mutations of the mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA in the genes that code for the subunits of the respiratory chain. The results obtained from using different drugs to treat these diseases vary widely. CASE REPORT: A 33-year-old female with a history of migraine with aura, who was admitted to hospital because of epileptic seizures. Neuroimaging tests showed left-side occipital insult and a biopsy study of a sample of brain tissue revealed gliosis and vacuolisation of the white matter. Lactic acid levels in blood were normal. No ragged red fibres were seen in the muscle biopsy, but there was evidence of a complex I deficiency in the respiratory chain. After establishing treatment with coenzyme Q and riboflavin, the patient had no further episodes of neurological disorders. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of elevated levels of lactate, ragged red fibres in the muscle biopsy or the negative results for mutations in the genetic study do not rule out the possible existence of a mitochondrial disease. The gliosis and vacuolisation of the white matter with respect to the neurons that were found in the results of the brain tissue biopsy must lead us to consider a mitochondrial disease.\n",

      "PMID:  29229235\n",
      "Abs: Valproic acid (VPA) is a well-established therapeutic used in treatment of seizure and mood disorders as well as migraines and a known hepatotoxicant. About 50% of VPA users experience metabolic disruptions, including weight gain, hyperlipidemia, and hyperinsulinemia, among others. Several of these metabolic abnormalities are similar to the effects of circadian rhythm disruption. In the current study, we examine the effect of VPA exposure on the expression of core circadian transcription factors that drive the circadian clock via a transcription-translation feedback loop. In cells with an unsynchronized clock, VPA simultaneously upregulated the expression of genes encoding core circadian transcription factors that regulate the positive and negative limbs of the feedback loop. Using low dose glucocorticoid, we synchronized cultured fibroblast cells to a circadian oscillatory pattern. Whether VPA was added at the time of synchronization or 12h later at CT12, we found that VPA disrupted the oscillatory expression of multiple genes encoding essential transcription factors that regulate circadian rhythm. Therefore, we conclude that VPA has a potent effect on the circadian rhythm transcription-translation feedback loop that may be linked to negative VPA side effects in humans. Furthermore, our study suggests potential chronopharmacology implications of VPA usage.CI - Copyright © 2017. Published by Elsevier Inc.\n",

      "PMID:  30423015\n",
      "Abs: Hypokalaemic periodic paralysis is a rare genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by episodes of skeletal muscle paralysis associated with low serum potassium. Muscle fibre inexcitability during attacks of paralysis is due to an aberrant depolarizing leak current through mutant voltage sensing domains of either the sarcolemmal voltage-gated calcium or sodium channel. We report a child with hypokalaemic periodic paralysis and CNS involvement, including seizures, but without mutations in the known periodic paralysis genes. We identified a novel heterozygous de novo missense mutation in the ATP1A2 gene encoding the α2 subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase that is abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle and in brain astrocytes. Pump activity is crucial for Na+ and K+ homeostasis following sustained muscle or neuronal activity and its dysfunction is linked to the CNS disorders hemiplegic migraine and alternating hemiplegia of childhood, but muscle dysfunction has not been reported. Electrophysiological measurements of mutant pump activity in Xenopus oocytes revealed lower turnover rates in physiological extracellular K+ and an anomalous inward leak current in hypokalaemic conditions, predicted to lead to muscle depolarization. Our data provide important evidence supporting a leak current as the major pathomechanism underlying hypokalaemic periodic paralysis and indicate ATP1A2 as a new hypokalaemic periodic paralysis gene.\n",

      "Title: Mechanisms of glyceryl trinitrate provoked mast cell degranulation\n",
      "PMID:  25724914\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Migraine patients develop attacks several hours after intravenous infusion of glyceryl trinitrate. Due to the short half-life of nitric oxide, this delayed migraine cannot be caused by a direct action of nitric oxide derived from glyceryl trinitrate. The involvement of meningeal inflammation and dural mast cell degranulation is supported by the effectiveness of prednisolone on glyceryl trinitrate-induced delayed headache. METHODS: Using a newly developed rat model mimicking the human glyceryl trinitrate headache model, we have investigated the occurrence of dural mast cell degranulation after a clinically relevant dose of glyceryl trinitrate. RESULTS: A 6-fold increase in degranulation was observed starting at 2 hours after glyceryl trinitrate infusion. Interestingly, pre-treatment with the effective anti-migraine substances L-nitro-arginine methyl ester and sumatriptan prevented glyceryl trinitrate-induced mast cell degranulation whereas the calcitonin gene-related peptide-receptor antagonist olcegepant and the substance P receptor antagonist L-733,060 did not affect mast cell degranulation. However, topical application of two different nitric oxide donors did not cause mast cell degranulation ex vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Direct application of an exogenous nitric oxide donor on dural mast cells does not cause mast cell degranulation ex vivo. In vivo application of the nitric oxide donor glyceryl trinitrate leads to a prominent level of degranulation via a yet unknown mechanism. This effect can be completely blocked by inhibition of the endogenous nitric oxide production and by 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists but is unaffected by calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P receptor antagonists.CI - © International Headache Society 2015.\n",

      "Title: In situ imaging reveals properties of purinergic signalling in trigeminal sensory ganglia in vitro\n",
      "PMID:  28822016\n",
      "Abs: Chronic pain is supported by sterile inflammation that induces sensitisation of sensory neurons to ambient stimuli including extracellular ATP acting on purinergic P2X receptors. The development of in vitro methods for drug screening would be useful to investigate cell crosstalk and plasticity mechanisms occurring during neuronal sensitisation and sterile neuroinflammation. Thus, we studied, at single-cell level, membrane pore dilation based on the uptake of a fluorescent probe following sustained ATP-gated P2X receptor function in neurons and non-neuronal cells of trigeminal ganglion cultures from wild-type (WT) and R192Q Ca(V)2.1 knock-in (KI) mice, a model of familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 characterised by neuronal sensitisation and higher release of soluble mediators. In WT cultures, pore responses were mainly evoked by ATP rather than benzoyl-ATP (BzATP) and partly inhibited by the P2X antagonist TNP-ATP. P2X7 receptors were expressed in trigeminal ganglia mainly by non-neuronal cells. In contrast, KI cultures showed higher expression of P2X7 receptors, stronger responses to BzATP, an effect largely prevented by prior administration of Ca(V)2.1 blocker ω-agatoxin IVA, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based silencing of P2X7 receptors or the P2X7 antagonist A-804598. No cell toxicity was detected with the protocols. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a well-known migraine mediator, potentiated BzATP-evoked membrane permeability in WT as well as R192Q KI cultures, demonstrating its modulatory role on trigeminal sensory ganglia. Our results show an advantageous experimental approach to dissect pharmacological properties potentially relevant to chronic pain and suggest that CGRP is a soluble mediator influencing purinergic P2X pore dilation and regulating inflammatory responses.\n",

      "PMID:  15288426\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) released from trigeminal primary afferents has been implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine. Here, we have used an in vitro slice preparation to investigate its release from nerve terminals in the rat trigeminal nucleus caudalis. Extracellular-calcium dependent CGRP release was stimulated by both capsaicin and neuronal depolarization with KCl. The capsaicin (1 microM)-evoked CGRP release was blocked by capsazepine and was also attenuated in the presence of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, an effect that was reversed when slices were stimulated with capsaicin in the presence of the cyclooxygenase metabolite, prostaglandin E(2). Taken together, these data further highlight the importance of prostaglandins as enhancers of neuropeptide release and suggest that CGRP released from the central terminals of trigeminal neurones has the potential to be involved in the transmission of nociceptive information of relevance to migraine headache.\n",

      "PMID:  22644186\n",
      "Abs: There are many categories and individual types of headache and most have a variety of treatment protocols, while a few are best treated by just one medication. This paper will concentrate on acute care medications for migraine and discuss some new and future acute care treatments. There is not much to discuss about prevention, except that onabotulinumtoxinA has been approved for prevention of chronic migraine. Cluster headache will also be discussed, as there are some future treatments for acute care and prevention being studied at present. For the acute care of migraine in the US, we have seven triptans by tablet plus other routes and one non steroidal anti-inflammatory medication approved by the FDA that is currently available (Cambia brand of buffered diclofenac potassium for oral solution). There are several other acute care medications in various stages of development and there are three new methods of administering a triptan and others under investigation. The optimal acute care therapy for migraine should be faster, easier to use and more efficient with fewer adverse events than what is currently available. What follows is a brief review of the status in development for five of the many new acute care medications being investigated: the CGRP antagonist tablet telcagepant, the sumatriptan iontophoretic patch Zelrix, sumatriptan powder for use in the OptiNose apparatus, dihydroergotamine for oral inhalation (Levadex), civamide nasal solution for prevention of episodic cluster headache (Civanex) and sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation for acute cluster attacks in chronic cluster headaches. Other future treatments that will not be discussed include transcranial magnetic stimulation, a 5-HT(1F) agonist named alniditan, large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel openers, glial modulators or other medications and devices in early stages of development.\n",

      "PMID:  26995359\n",
      "Abs: The m.8344A>G mutation in the MTTK gene, which encodes the mitochondrial transfer RNA for lysine, is traditionally associated with myoclonic epilepsy and ragged-red fibres (MERRF), a multisystemic mitochondrial disease that is characterised by myoclonus, seizures, cerebellar ataxia, and mitochondrial myopathy with ragged-red fibres. We studied the clinical and paraclinical phenotype of 34 patients with the m.8344A>G mutation, mainly derived from the nationwide mitoREGISTER, the multicentric registry of the German network for mitochondrial disorders (mitoNET). Mean age at symptom onset was 24.5 years ±10.9 (6-48 years) with adult onset in 75 % of the patients. In our cohort, the canonical features seizures, myoclonus, cerebellar ataxia and ragged-red fibres that are traditionally associated with MERRF, occurred in only 61, 59, 70, and 63 % of the patients, respectively. In contrast, other features such as hearing impairment were even more frequently present (72 %). Other common features in our cohort were migraine (52 %), psychiatric disorders (54 %), respiratory dysfunction (45 %), gastrointestinal symptoms (38 %), dysarthria (36 %), and dysphagia (35 %). Brain MRI revealed cerebral and/or cerebellar atrophy in 43 % of our patients. There was no correlation between the heteroplasmy level in blood and age at onset or clinical phenotype. Our findings further broaden the clinical spectrum of the m.8344A>G mutation, document the large clinical variability between carriers of the same mutation, even within families and indicate an overlap of the phenotype with other mitochondrial DNA-associated syndromes.\n",

      "PMID:  20472035\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) has a key role in migraine and recently CGRP receptor antagonists have demonstrated clinical efficacy in the treatment of migraine. However, it remains unclear where the CGRP receptors are located within the CGRP signaling pathway in the human trigeminal system and hence the potential antagonist sites of action remain unknown. Therefore we designed a study to evaluate the localization of CGRP and its receptor components calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity modifying protein (RAMP) 1 in the human trigeminal ganglion using immunohistochemistry and compare with that of rat. Antibodies against purified CLR and RAMP1 proteins were produced and characterized for this study. Trigeminal ganglia were obtained at autopsy from adult subjects and sections from rat trigeminal ganglia were used to compare the immunostaining pattern. The number of cells expressing CGRP, CLR and RAMP1, respectively, were counted. In addition, the glial cells of trigeminal ganglion, particularly the satellite glial cell, were studied to understand a possible relation. We observed immunoreactivity for CGRP, CLR and RAMP1, in the human trigeminal ganglion: 49% of the neurons expressed CGRP, 37% CLR and 36% RAMP1. Co-localization of CGRP and the receptor components was rarely found. There were no CGRP immunoreactions in the glial cells; however some of the glial cells displayed CLR and RAMP1 immunoreactivity. Similar results were observed in rat trigeminal ganglia. We report that human and rat trigeminal neurons store CGRP, CLR and RAMP1; however, CGRP and CLR/RAMP1 do not co-localize regularly but are found in separate neurons. Glial cells also contain the CGRP receptor components but not CGRP. Our results indicate, for the first time, the possibility of CGRP signaling in the human trigeminal ganglion involving both neurons and satellite glial cells. This suggests a possible site of action for the novel CGRP receptor antagonists in migraine therapy.CI - Copyright (c) 2010 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "PMID:  11087777\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is involved in the pathophysiology of migraine and cluster headache. Whether CGRP has any role in chronic tension-type headache is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To compare interictal plasma levels of CGRP between patients with chronic tension-type headache and healthy control subjects, to investigate plasma CGRP in relation to headache state, and to compare plasma CGRP between the peripheral and the cranial circulation. METHODS: Blood from the antecubital vein was drawn from 30 patients with chronic tension-type headache and 34 healthy control subjects. In addition, blood samples from the consecutive first 15 patients and from the consecutive first 20 healthy control subjects were also collected from the external jugular vein. RESULTS: CGRP levels measured in the peripheral circulation in patients on days without headache, 63+/-5 pmol/L, tended to be higher than CGRP levels in control subjects, 53+/-3 pmol/L (p = 0.06). In patients, no differences were found between CGRP levels assessed ictally and interictally in either the cranial (p = 0.91) or the peripheral (p = 0.62) circulation. Plasma CGRP level was higher in the external jugular vein than in the antecubital vein on days without headache (p = 0.03) but not on days with headache (p = 0.82). In control subjects, CGRP levels in the cranial circulation did not differ from CGRP levels in the peripheral circulation (p = 0.92). Exploratory analyses showed that 8 patients whose usual headache quality was throbbing had a higher interictal plasma CGRP level than control subjects (p = 0.002), whereas plasma CGRP level was normal in 22 patients with pressing headaches (p = 0.36). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma levels of CGRP are normal in patients with chronic tension-type headache and are unrelated to headache state. Interictal plasma CGRP was increased in patients with a pulsating pain quality. Because the authors have previously shown a similar increase of interictal CGRP levels in migraine, this study suggests that headaches with symptoms that fulfill International Headache Society criteria for tension-type headache may be pathophysiologically related to migraine, if the headache has a pulsating quality.\n",

      "PMID:  31475573\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Botulinum neurotoxin type A, an FDA-approved prophylactic drug for chronic migraine, is thought to achieve its therapeutic effect through blocking activation of unmyelinated meningeal nociceptors and their downstream communications with myelinated nociceptors and potentially the vasculature and immune cells. Prior investigations to determine botulinum neurotoxin type A effects on meningeal nociceptors were carried out in male rats and tested with stimuli that act outside the blood brain barrier. Here, we sought to explore the effects of extracranial injections of botulinum neurotoxin type A on activation of meningeal nociceptors by cortical spreading depression, an event which occurs inside the blood brain barrier, in female rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using single-unit recording, we studied myelinated C- and unmyelinated Aδ-meningeal nociceptors' responses to cortical spreading depression 7-14 days after injection of botulinum neurotoxin type A or saline along calvarial sutures. RESULTS: In female rats, responses to cortical spreading depression were typically more prolonged and, in some cases, began at relatively longer latencies post-cortical spreading depression, than had been observed in previous studies in male rats. Extracranial administration of botulinum neurotoxin type A reduced significantly the prolonged firing of the meningeal nociceptors, in the combined sample of Aδ- and C-fiber, but not their response probability. DISCUSSION: The findings suggest that the mechanism of action by which botulinum neurotoxin type A prevents migraine differ from the one by which calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibodies prevent migraine and that even when the origin of migraine is central (i.e. in the cortex), a peripherally acting drug can intercept/prevent the headache.\n",

      "Abs: Nitric oxide and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) have been implicated in craniofacial pain including migraine headache, and CGRP induces face-grooming indicative of nocifensive behavior in animals. The aim of this study was to test whether systemic administration of nitroglycerin (NTG) influences the CGRP-induced behavior in awake rats and whether sumatriptan, a 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist, can block the effects of NTG. CGRP was not significantly different from normal saline in inducing face-grooming behavior but NTG facilitated the effect of CGRP. Furthermore, sumatriptan was found to block the effect of NTG. These data suggest that facilitatory processes involving nitric oxide may be necessary for CGRP to play a role in some craniofacial pain conditions including possibly migraine headache.\n",

      "PMID:  30419806\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Perampanel is a novel antiepileptic drug acting via non-competitive antagonism on glutamatergic AMPA receptors, and the subsequent inhibition of ion calcium influx. Since it was recently postulated that the antagonists of glutamate receptors might play a role in the treatment of migraine, in this study we investigated the putative anti-migraine activity of perampanel in an in vitro animal model involving the static incubation of rat brainstem explants and the subsequent measurement of immune-reactive calcitonin gene-related peptide released into the incubation medium. METHODS: Acute rat brainstem explants were incubated in plain medium or in medium containing graded concentrations of perampanel. The release into the medium was assessed by radioimmunoassay either under baseline conditions or after stimulation by such secretagogues as high K(+) concentrations, veratridine or capsaicin. RESULTS: We found that: 1) under baseline conditions perampanel, given in the range 0.01-100 μM, inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner calcitonin gene-related peptide's release compared to controls; the decrease was statistically significant as from 10 μM; 2) a significant and consistent increase in calcitonin gene-related peptide's secretion was induced by all depolarizing stimuli after 1 h of incubation; 3) under these conditions, calcitonin gene-related peptide's release stimulated by 56 mM KCl was significantly reduced by perampanel from 0.1 μM onward, whereas secretion stimulated by veratridine was significantly reduced as from 1 μM; 4) on the contrary, perampanel had no effect on capsaicin-induced calcitonin gene-related peptide's release up to 100 μM. CONCLUSIONS: Here we provided preliminary in vitro evidence suggesting that perampanel might control pain transmission under conditions of activated trigeminal system, in a preclinical model mimicking the pathophysiology of human migraine.\n",

      "PMID:  23667248\n",
      "Abs: The ovarian cycle affects susceptibility to behavioral and neurologic conditions. The molecular mechanisms underlying these changes are poorly understood. Deficits in cyclical fluctuations in steroid hormones and receptor plasticity play a central role in physiologic and pathophysiologic menstrual conditions. It has been suggested that synaptic GABA(A) receptors mediate phasic inhibition in the hippocampus and extrasynaptic receptors mediate tonic inhibition in the dentate gyrus. Here we report a novel role of extrasynaptic δ-containing GABA(A) receptors as crucial mediators of the estrous cycle-related changes in neuronal excitability in mice, with hippocampus subfield specificity. In molecular and immunofluorescence studies, a significant increase occurred in δ-subunit, but not α4- and γ2-subunits, in the dentate gyrus during diestrus. However, δ-subunit upregulation was not evident in the CA1 region. The δ-subunit expression was undiminished by age and ovariectomy and in mice lacking progesterone receptors, but it was significantly reduced by finasteride, a neurosteroid synthesis inhibitor. Electrophysiologic studies confirmed greater potentiation of GABA currents by progesterone-derived neurosteroid allopregnanolone in dissociated dentate gyrus granule cells in diestrus than in CA1 pyramidal cells. The baseline conductance and allopregnanolone potentiation of tonic currents in dentate granule cells from hippocampal slices were higher than in CA1 pyramidal cells. In behavioral studies, susceptibility to hippocampus kindling epileptogenesis was lower in mice during diestrus. These results demonstrate the estrous cycle-related plasticity of neurosteroid-sensitive, δ-containing GABA(A) receptors that mediate tonic inhibition and seizure susceptibility. These findings may provide novel insight on molecular cascades of menstrual disorders like catamenial epilepsy, premenstrual syndrome, and migraine.\n",

      "PMID:  23115190\n",
      "Abs: Mutations in the CACNA1A gene are associated with neurological disorders, such as ataxia, hemiplegic migraine, and epilepsy. These mutations affect the pore-forming α(1A)-subunit of Ca(V)2.1 channels and thereby either decrease or increase neuronal Ca(2+) influx. A decreased Ca(V)2.1-mediated Ca(2+) influx has been shown to reduce the regularity of cerebellar Purkinje cell activity and to induce episodic cerebellar ataxia. However, little is known about how ataxia can be caused by CACNA1A mutations that increase the Ca(2+) influx, such as the S218L missense mutation. Here, we demonstrate that the S218L mutation causes a negative shift of voltage dependence of Ca(V)2.1 channels of mouse Purkinje cells and results in lowered thresholds for somatic action potentials and dendritic Ca(2+) spikes and in disrupted firing patterns. The hyperexcitability of Cacna1a(S218L) Purkinje cells was counteracted by application of the activators of Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) channels, 1-EBIO and chlorzoxazone (CHZ). Moreover, 1-EBIO also alleviated the irregularity of Purkinje cell firing both in vitro and in vivo, while CHZ improved the irregularity of Purkinje cell firing in vitro as well as the motor performance of Cacna1a(S218L) mutant mice. The current data suggest that abnormalities in Purkinje cell firing contributes to cerebellar ataxia induced by the S218L mutation and they advocate a general therapeutic approach in that targeting Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) channels may be beneficial for treating ataxia not only in patients suffering from a decreased Ca(2+) influx, but also in those suffering from an increased Ca(2+) influx in their Purkinje cells.\n",

      "PMID:  15207916\n",
      "Abs: Oligemia is blood flow reduction without acute tissue damage that occurs in shock, migraine, and stroke penumbra. We developed a mouse model of oligemia by lowering mean arterial pressure to 30-40 mm Hg, resulting in a 50% reduction in cerebral blood flow as measured by laser Doppler, and reperfusing the blood after 30 min. Control experiments included anesthesia-only and surgery without blood withdrawal. Using immunohistochemistry, we localized the transcription factors Nrf2, which regulates expression of antioxidant and detoxification protein, and c-Fos, a marker of neuronal activation. Nrf2 was found only in oligemia mice and was localized in neurons of the cingulate cortex and cerebellar Purkinje cells. By contrast, c-Fos was found widely expressed in both groups and was localized in neurons in regions associated with response to stress, immunomodulation, and fluid homeostasis, including the periaqueductal gray and periventricular nucleus. These data indicate that c-Fos expression occurs as a result of surgical stress, but Nrf-2 upregulation is specific to oligemia. The CLONTECH Atlas 1.2 Mouse Array was used to assess genes that were up or down-regulated in oligemia versus surgery controls. Of 1176 genes, 29 differed between oligemia and surgery groups. Upregulation of oxidative stress induced (OSI) protein, heat shock protein (HSP) 84 and transthyretin (TTR) precursor in the oligemia group was confirmed with RT-PCR. The expression of HSP 84, transthyretin precursor, and OSI genes adds further evidence that oligemia induces an oxidative stress response in the brain.\n",

      "Abs: Migraine is the third most common disease in the world (behind dental caries and tension-type headache) with an estimated global prevalence of 15%, yet its etiology remains poorly understood. Recent clinical trials have heralded the potential of therapeutic antibodies that block the actions of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) or its receptor to prevent migraine. Calcitonin gene-related peptide is believed to contribute to trigeminal nerve hypersensitivity and photosensitivity in migraine, but a direct role in pain associated with migraine has not been established. In this study, we report that peripherally administered CGRP can act in a light-independent manner to produce spontaneous pain in mice that is manifested as a facial grimace. As an objective validation of the orbital tightening action unit of the grimace response, we developed a squint assay using a video-based measurement of the eyelid fissure, which confirmed a significant squint response after CGRP injection, both in complete darkness and very bright light. These indicators of discomfort were completely blocked by preadministration of a monoclonal anti-CGRP-blocking antibody. However, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug meloxicam failed to block the effect of CGRP. Interestingly, an apparent sex-specific response to treatment was observed with the antimigraine drug sumatriptan partially blocking the CGRP response in male, but not female mice. These results demonstrate that CGRP can induce spontaneous pain, even in the absence of light, and that the squint response provides an objective biomarker for CGRP-induced pain that is translatable to humans.\n",

      "PMID:  29209105\n",
      "Abs: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently used to treat migraine, but the mechanisms of their effects in this pathology are not fully elucidated. The trigeminal ganglia and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) have been implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine. The release of CGRP and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) from freshly isolated rat trigeminal ganglia was evaluated after oral administration of nimesulide, etoricoxib, and ketoprofen, NSAIDs with different pharmacological features. Thirty minutes after oral administration, nimesulide, 10 mg/Kg, decreased the GCRP release induced by an inflammatory soup, while the other NSAIDs were ineffective at this point in time. Two hours after oral nimesulide (5 and 10 mg/Kg) and ketoprofen (10 mg/Kg), but not of etoricoxib, a significant decrease in the CGRP release was observed. All drugs reduced PGE(2), although with some differences in timing and doses, and the action on CGRP does not seem to be related to PGE(2) inhibition. The reduction of CGRP release from rat trigeminal ganglia after nimesulide and ketoprofen may help to explain the mechanism of action of NSAIDs in migraine. Since at 30 minutes only nimesulide was effective in reducing CGRP release, these results suggest that this NSAID may exert a particularly rapid effect in patients with migraine.\n",

      "PMID:  12789484\n",
      "Abs: Nitric oxide (NO) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), potent vasodilators in the meninges,may be involved in the pathophysiology of vascular headaches such as migraine pain. NO donators can provoke headache attacks in migraineurs and increased levels of CGRP have been found in the venous outflow from the head during migraine attacks. We therefore examined the effect of both NO and CGRP on dural blood, a process which may parallel nociceptive processes in the meninges. 1. Arterial blood flow was measured in the exposed dura mater encephali of the rat using laser Doppler flowmetry. Local application of different NO donors (SNAP,NONOate, and NOC-12) caused dose-dependent increases in meningeal blood flow. CGRP(8-37) at 10(-4) M did not significantly change the basal flow but attenuated increases in blood flow caused by the NO donors at concentrations of 10(-5)-10(-3) M.2. In another series of experiments, the hemisected skulls of adult Wistar rats, complete with intact dura mater, were filled with oxygenated synthetic interstitial fluid (SIF) and the CGRP content of this fluid was assessed every 5 min. When the NO donator NONOate, at concentrations of 10(-5)-10(-3) M, was added to the SIF, or when the SIF was bubbled with NO gas (1000 ppm in N(2) atmosphere) instead of carbogen, CGRP release increased in a concentration-dependent manner. We conclude that the vasodilatory effect of NO that causes increased meningeal blood flow is in part the result of both stimulating the release of CGRP and promoting the vasodilatory action of CGRP. Since NO donors such as nitroglycerin are known to provoke headache and CGRP is released during migraine pain, the NO-stimulated CGRP release may be relevant for the development of vascular headaches that are accompanied by meningeal hyperaemia.\n",

      "PMID:  23115181\n",
      "Abs: The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of migraine. We have focused on the role of CGRP in photophobia, which is a common migraine symptom. We previously used an operant-based assay to show that CGRP-sensitized transgenic (nestin/hRAMP1), but not control, mice exhibited light aversion in response to an intracerebroventricular CGRP injection. A key question was whether the transgenic phenotype was due to overexpression of the CGRP receptor at endogenous or novel expression sites. We reasoned that if endogenous receptor sites were sufficient for light-aversive behavior, then wild-type mice should also show the phenotype when given a sufficiently strong stimulus. In this study, we report that mice with normal levels of endogenous CGRP receptors demonstrate light avoidance following CGRP administration. This phenotype required the combination of two factors: higher light intensity and habituation to the testing chamber. Control tests confirmed that light aversion was dependent on coincident exposure to CGRP and light and cannot be fully explained by increased anxiety. Furthermore, CGRP reduced locomotion only in the dark, not in the light. Coadministration of rizatriptan, a 5-HT(1B/D) agonist anti-migraine drug, attenuated the effects of exogenous CGRP on light aversion and motility. This suggests that triptans can act by mechanisms that are distinct from inhibition of CGRP release. Thus, we demonstrate that activation of endogenous CGRP receptors is sufficient to elicit light aversion in mice, which can be modulated by a drug commonly used to treat migraine.\n",

      "PMID:  12183331\n",
      "Abs: 1. The detailed pathophysiology of migraine is beginning to be understood and is likely to involve activation of trigeminovascular afferents. 2. Clinically effective anti-migraine compounds are believed to have actions that include peripheral inhibition of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release from trigeminal neurones, or preventing dural vessel dilation, or both. CGRP antagonists can block both neurogenic and CGRP-induced dural vessel dilation. 3. Nitric oxide (NO) can induce headache in migraine patients and often triggers a delayed migraine. The initial headache is thought to be caused via a direct action of the NO-cGMP pathway that causes vasodilation by vascular smooth muscle relaxation, while the delayed headache is likely to be a result of triggering trigeminovascular activation. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors are effective in the treatment of acute migraine. 4. The present studies used intravital microscopy to examine the effects of specific NOS inhibitors on neurogenic dural vasodilation (NDV) and CGRP-induced dilation. 5. The non-specific and neuronal NOS (nNOS) inhibitors were able to partially inhibit NDV, while the non-specific and endothelial NOS (eNOS) inhibitors were able to partially inhibit the CGRP induced dilation. 6. There was no effect of the inducible NOS (iNOS) inhibitor. 7. The data suggest that the delayed headache response triggered by NO donors in humans may be due, in part, to increased nNOS activity in the trigeminal system that causes CGRP release and dural vessel dilation. 8. Further, eNOS activity in the endothelium causes NO production and smooth muscle relaxation by direct activation of the NO-cGMP pathway, and may be involved in the initial headache response.\n",

      "Abs: The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is known to play a major role in the pathogenesis of pain syndromes, in particular migraine pain; however, its implication in inflammatory processes is not well known. The CGRP receptor antagonist BIBN4096BS was shown to reduce migraine pain and trigeminal neuronal activity. An analgesic action of this compound can also be found in rats with induced acute inflammation by injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in one hindpaw. In this model the compound reduced inflammatory pain and spinal neuronal activity. Behavioral experiments (Randall-Selitto test) revealed a reversal of the CFA-induced mechanical hyperalgesia in rats after systemic drug administration. In vivo electrophysiological studies performed in rats injected with CFA using recordings of wide dynamic range neurons in deep dorsal horn layers of the lumbar spinal cord, confirmed a reduction of neuronal activity after systemic drug administration. The same considerable amount of reduction occurred after topical administration onto the paw with resulting systemic plasma concentrations in the low nanomolar range. Spinal administration of BIBN4096BS did not modify the neuronal activity in the CFA model which suggests that peripheral blockade of CGRP receptors by BIBN4096BS significantly alleviates inflammatory pain.\n",

      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a potent dilator of cerebral and dural vasculature, is known to be elevated in plasma and cerebral spinal fluid during migraine attacks. Selective blockade of the CGRP receptor offers the promise of controlling migraine headache more effectively and without the side-effects associated with the use of triptans. Our efforts to develop a novel, peptide-based CGRP antagonist focused on the C-terminal portion of the peptide which is known to bind the receptor but lack agonist properties. Extensive SAR studies of the C-terminal CGRP (27-37) region identified a novel cyclic structure: Bz-Val-Tyr-cyclo[Cys-Thr-Asp-Val-Gly-Pro-Phe-Cys]-Phe-NH(2) (23) with a kb value of 0.126 nM against the cloned human CGRP receptor. Additional SAR studies directed at enhancement of potency and improvement of physicochemical properties yielded a series of analogs with kb values in the 0.05-0.10 nM range.CI - Copyright © 2011 European Peptide Society and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n",

About one-half of the affected individuals had migraine headaches and several had episodes typical of basilar migraine.

      "Abs: We describe an autosomal recessive condition characterized with cerebral vasculopathy and early onset of stroke in 14 individuals in Old Order Amish. The phenotype of the condition was highly heterogeneous, ranging from severe developmental disability to normal schooling. Cerebral vasculopathy was a major hallmark of the condition with a common theme of multifocal stenoses and aneurysms in large arteries, accompanied by chronic ischemic changes, moyamoya morphology, and evidence of prior acute infarction and hemorrhage. Early signs of the disease included mild intrauterine growth restriction, infantile hypotonia, and irritability, followed by failure to thrive and short stature. Acrocyanosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, chilblain lesions, low-pitch hoarse voice, glaucoma, migraine headache, and arthritis were frequently observed. The early onset or recurrence of strokes secondary to cerebral vasculopathy seems to always be associated with poor outcomes. The elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), IgG, neopterin, and TNF-α found in these patients suggested an immune disorder. Through genomewide homozygosity mapping, we localized the disease gene to chromosome (Chr) 20q11.22-q12. Candidate gene sequencing identified a homozygous mutation, c.1411-2A > G, in the SAMHD1 gene, being associated with this condition. The mutation appeared at the splice-acceptor site of intron 12, resulted in the skipping of exon 13, and gave rise to an aberrant protein with in-frame deletion of 31 amino acids. Immunoblotting analysis showed lack of mutant SAMHD1 protein expression in affected cell lines. The function of SAMHD1 remains unclear, but the inflammatory vasculopathies of the brain found in the patients with SAMHD1 mutation indicate its important roles in immunoregulation and cerebral vascular hemeostasis.\n",

      "PMID:  30784351\n",
      "Abs: Migraine is triggered by poor air quality and odors through unknown mechanisms. Activation of the trigeminovascular pathway by environmental irritants may occur via activation of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) receptors on nasal trigeminal neurons, but how that results in peripheral and central sensitization is unclear. The anatomy of the trigeminal ganglion suggests that noxious nasal stimuli are not being transduced to the meninges by axon reflex but likely through intraganglionic transmission. Consistent with this concept, we injected calcitonin gene-related peptide, adenosine triphosphate, or glutamate receptor antagonists or a gap junction channel blocker directly and exclusively into the trigeminal ganglion and blocked meningeal blood flow changes in response to acute nasal TRP agonists. Previously, we observed chronic sensitization of the trigeminovascular pathway after acrolein exposure, a known TRPA1 receptor agonist. To explore the mechanism of this sensitization, we utilized laser dissection microscopy to separately harvest nasal and meningeal trigeminal neuron populations in the absence or presence of acrolein exposure. mRNA levels of neurotransmitters important in migraine were then determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. TRPA1 message levels were significantly increased in meningeal cell populations following acrolein exposure compared to room air exposure. This was specific to TRPA1 message in meningeal cell populations as changes were not observed in either nasal trigeminal cell populations or dorsal root ganglion populations. Taken together, these data suggest an important role for intraganglionic transmission in acute activation of the trigeminovascular pathway. It also supports a role for upregulation of TRPA1 receptors in peripheral sensitization and a possible mechanism for chronification of migraine after environmental irritant exposure.\n",

      "PMID:  19614683\n",
      "Abs: We included 58 patients with meningioma in a prospective study to analyse the prevalence of and risk factors for different types of meningioma-associated headache. Twenty-three patients (40%) had meningioma-associated headache. Of these, the pain was migraine-like in five (22%) and tension-type headache (TTH)-like in 13 (57%). Sixteen of 21 (76%) experienced relief of pain intensity of at least 50% after 18-24 months. Univariate analysis revealed bone-invasive growth pattern (P = 0.007) as a risk factor for headache and intake of antiepileptic drugs (P = 0.04) or large surrounding oedema (P = 0.04) as possible protective parameters. For migraine-like headache, risk factors were a positive history of migraine (P = 0.009) and bone-invasive growth pattern (P = 0.046) and, for TTH-like headache, only bone-invasive growth pattern (P = 0.009). Binary logistic regression analysis added to assess predictability and interaction effects could not identify a single factor predicting the occurrence of headache in the presence of a meningioma (correct prediction in 74% by a model consisting of bone-invasive growth pattern, history of head surgery, intake of antiepileptic drugs, temporal tumour location and moderate and large surrounding oedema). Analysis of 38 tumour specimens could not confirm the hypothesis that the occurrence of headache correlates with the expression magnitude of signal substances known to be present in meningiomas [stroma cell-derived factor 1, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, vascular endothelial growth factor A] or thought to be relevant to headache/pain pathophysiology [prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2, calcitonin-related polypeptide alpha, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) 1, NOS2A, NOS3, transforming growth factor-alpha, tumour necrosis factor, tachykinin, vasoactive intestinal peptide]. The affection of bone integrity and the expression of molecules thought to be relevant to headache pathophysiology might be important for meningioma-associated headache in predisposed individuals.\n",

We report a retrospective studies on 38 patients issued from our medical department, all heterozygous for the factor II mutation and a literature review. METHODS: We have studied 38 patients, all heterozygous for the factor II mutation, selected through a population of 516 tested patients issued from our medical department from 1997 to 2002. The research was performed face with history of thrombotic or obstetrical events, angiopathy or familial screening. RESULTS: Twenty out of thirty-eight patients have at least one episode of venous thrombosis: superficial thromboses, deep thromboses and/or pulmonary embolism. One case of cerebral thrombophlebitis is observed. Venous thrombotic risk factors are associated in 12 cases (60%). Four out of thirty-eight patients have one episode of arterial thrombosis: cardiovascular, peripheral or cerebral. Arterial thrombotic risk factors are associated in all cases. Median age of the first venous thrombosis is earlier than the one of arterial thrombosis (39.11 versus 49.25 years). CONCLUSION: Our studies confirms the interest to search the prothrombin gene mutation when faced with a venous thrombotic event (deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism) with or without acquired risk factors. Its involvement in thrombotic arterial disease is still a matter of debate. Data concerning its involvement in systemic diseases and angiopathies (thromboangeitis obliterans, Raynaud's phenomenon and migraine) are still needed. Mechanisms of thromboses could be an increase of prothrombin plasma level with high thrombin synthesis.\n",

      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) induces headache exacerbation with migraine-like features in patients with persistent post-traumatic headache (PTH) attributed to mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover study was conducted. Analyses were intention-to-treat. Eligible patients were aged 18 to 65 years and had a history of persistent PTH after mild TBI for at least 12 months. Patients were randomized to receive an intravenous infusion of 1.5μg/min of CGRP or placebo (isotonic saline) over 20 minutes on two separate experimental days. A 12-hour observational period was used to evaluate the following outcomes: (1) difference in incidence of headache exacerbation with migraine-like features and (2) difference in area under the curve for headache intensity scores. RESULTS: Thirty patients (mean age = 37 years, 25 women [83%]) were randomized and completed the study. During the 12-hour observational period, 21 of 30 patients (70%) developed headache exacerbation with migraine-like features after CGRP, compared with 6 patients (20%) after placebo (p < 0.001). The baseline-corrected area under the curve for headache intensity scores was significantly larger after CGRP, compared with placebo (p < 0.001). INTERPRETATION: Patients with persistent PTH are hypersensitive to CGRP, which underscores its pathophysiological importance. Furthermore, CGRP-targeted therapies might provide a novel mechanism-based treatment option for patients with persistent PTH.

Efficacy of CGRP monoclonal antibodies and antagonists in migraine treatment has fueled an increasing interest in the prospect of treating cluster headache (CH) with CGRP antagonism. The exact role of CGRP and its mechanism of action in CH have not been fully clarified. A search for original studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English was performed in PubMed and in ClinicalTrials.gov . The search term used was \"cluster headache and calcitonin gene related peptide\" and \"primary headaches and calcitonin gene related peptide.\" Reference lists of identified articles were also searched for additional relevant papers. Human experimental studies have reported elevated plasma CGRP levels during both spontaneous and glyceryl trinitrate-induced cluster attacks. CGRP may play an important role in cluster headache pathophysiology. More refined human studies are warranted with regard to assay validation and using larger sample sizes. The results from RCTs may reveal the therapeutic potential of CGRP monoclonal antibodies and antagonists for cluster headache treatment.\n",

      "Abs: Alterations in the folate pathway have been related to both major depression and cognitive inflexibility; however, they have not been investigated in the genetic background of ruminative response style, which is a form of perseverative cognition and a risk factor for depression. In the present study, we explored the association of rumination (measured by the Ruminative Responses Scale) with polymorphisms of two distinct folate pathway genes, MTHFR rs1801133 (C677T) and MTHFD1L rs11754661, in a combined European white sample from Budapest, Hungary (n=895) and Manchester, United Kingdom (n=1309). Post hoc analysis investigated whether the association could be replicated in each of the two samples, and the relationship between folate pathway genes, rumination, lifetime depression and Brief Symptom Inventory depression score. Despite its functional effect on folate metabolism, the MTHFR rs1801133 showed no effect on rumination. However, the A allele of MTHFD1L rs11754661 was significantly associated with greater rumination, and this effect was replicated in both the Budapest and Manchester samples. In addition, rumination completely mediated the effects of MTHFD1L rs11754661 on depression phenotypes. These findings suggest that the MTHFD1L gene, and thus the C1-THF synthase enzyme of the folate pathway localized in mitochondria, has an important effect on the pathophysiology of depression through rumination, and maybe via this cognitive intermediate phenotype on other mental and physical disorders. Further research should unravel whether the reversible metabolic effect of MTHFD1L is responsible for increased rumination or other long-term effects on brain development.\n",

      "PMID:  28176234\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Frequent mild head injuries or concussion along with the presence of headache may contribute to the persistence of concussion symptoms. METHODS: In this study, the acute ﻿effects of recovery between mild head injuries and the frequency of injuries on a headache behavior, trigeminal allodynia, was assessed using von Frey testing up to one week after injury,﻿ while histopathological changes in the trigeminal pain pathway were evaluated using western blot, ELISA and immunohistochemistry. ﻿ RESULTS: A decreased recovery time combined with an increased mild closed head injury (CHI) frequency results in reduced trigeminal allodynia thresholds compared to controls. The repetitive CHI group with the highest injury frequency showed the greatest reduction in trigeminal thresholds along with greatest increased levels ﻿of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. Repetitive CHI resulted in astrogliosis in the central trigeminal system, increased GFAP protein levels in the sensory barrel cortex, and an increased number of microglia cells in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. CONCLUSIONS: Headache behavior in rats is dependent on the injury frequency and recovery interval between mild head injuries. A worsening of headache behavior after repetitive mild head injuries was concomitant with increases in CGRP levels, the presence of astrocytosis, and microglia proliferation in the central trigeminal pathway. Signaling between neurons and proliferating microglia in the trigeminal pain system may contribute to the initiation of acute headache after concussion or other traumatic brain injuries.\n",

More than 300 new mutations have been identified to date, with missense mutations being the most common in GEFS(+) and more deleterious mutations (nonsense, frameshift) representing the majority of SMEI mutations. Microchromosomal abnormalities including SCN1A deletions, amplifications, and duplications are also found in patients with SMEI. Deletions range in size from one single exon to abnormalities extending beyond SCN1A and involving contiguous genes. The majority of SCN1A mutations in SMEI arise de novo. SCN1A mutations are found throughout the protein structure, and some clustering of mutations is observed in the C-terminus and the loops between segments 5 and 6 of the first three domains of the protein.

      "PMID:  18416824\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: The aberrant release of the neurotransmitters, glutamate and calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP), from trigeminal neurons has been implicated in migraine. The voltage-gated P/Q-type calcium channel has a critical role in controlling neurotransmitter release and has been linked to Familial Hemiplegic Migraine. Therefore, we examined the importance of voltage-dependent calcium channels in controlling release of glutamate and CGRP from trigeminal ganglion neurons isolated from male and female rats and grown in culture. Serotonergic pathways are likely involved in migraine, as triptans, a class of 5-HT1 receptor agonists, are effective in the treatment of migraine and their effectiveness may be due to inhibiting neurotransmitter release from trigeminal neurons. We also studied the effect of serotonin receptor activation on release of glutamate and CGRP from trigeminal neurons grown in culture. RESULTS: P/Q-, N- and L-type channels each mediate a significant fraction of potassium-stimulated release of glutamate and CGRP. We determined that 5-HT significantly inhibits potassium-stimulated release of both glutamate and CGRP. Serotonergic inhibition of both CGRP and glutamate release can be blocked by pertussis toxin and NAS-181, a 5-HT1B/1D antagonist. Stimulated release of CGRP is unaffected by Y-25130, a 5-HT3 antagonist and SB 200646, a 5-HT2B/2C antagonist. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that release of both glutamate and CGRP from trigeminal neurons is controlled by calcium channels and modulated by 5-HT signaling in a pertussis-toxin dependent manner and probably via 5-HT1 receptor signaling. This is the first characterization of glutamate release from trigeminal neurons grown in culture.\n",

      "PMID:  25608878\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: During migraine, capsaicin-sensitive trigeminal sensory nerves release calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), resulting in cranial vasodilatation and central nociception. Moreover, 5-HT is involved in the pathophysiology of migraine and depression. Interestingly, some limited lines of evidence suggest that fluoxetine may be effective in migraine prophylaxis, but the underlying mechanisms are uncertain. Hence, this study investigated the canine external carotid vasodilator responses to capsaicin, α-CGRP and acetylcholine before and after acute and chronic oral treatment with fluoxetine. METHODS: Forty-eight vagosympathectomised male mongrel dogs were prepared to measure blood pressure, heart rate and external carotid blood flow. The thyroid artery was cannulated for infusions of agonists. In 16 of these dogs, a spinal cannula was inserted (C1-C3) for infusions of 5-HT. RESULTS: The external carotid vasodilator responses to capsaicin, α-CGRP and acetylcholine remained unaffected after intracarotid or i.v. fluoxetine. In contrast, the vasodilator responses to capsaicin, but not those to α-CGRP or acetylcholine, were inhibited after chronic oral treatment with fluoxetine (300 µg/kg; for 90 days) or intrathecal 5-HT. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic oral fluoxetine inhibited capsaicin-induced external carotid vasodilatation, and this inhibition could partly explain its potential prophylactic antimigraine action.CI - © International Headache Society 2015.\n",

Recent studies found mutations in four genes (SLC20A2, PDGFRB, PDGFB and XPR1). However, these gene represent only 60% of all familial cases suggesting other genes remain to be elucidated. Studies evaluating treatments for such a devastating disease are scattered, usually appearing as single case reports. In the present study, we describe a case series of 7 patients treated with Alendronate, a widely prescribed biphosphanate. We observed good tolerance and evidence of improvements and stability by some patients. No side effects were reported and no specific symptoms related to medication. Younger patients and one individual continuing a prescription (prior to study commencement) appeared to respond more positively with some referred improvements in symptoms. Biphosphanates may represent an excellent prospect for the treatment of brain calcifications due to their being well tolerated and easily available. Conversely, prospective and controlled studies should promptly address weaknesses found in the present analysis.\n",

      "Title: 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT)-induced valvulopathy: compositional valvular alterations are associated with 5HT2B receptor and 5HT transporter transcript changes in Sprague-Dawley rats\n",
      "PMID:  18511249\n",
      "Abs: Several drugs have been linked to valvulopathy in humans, including therapeutic agents for obesity, Parkinson's disease and migraine. There is increasing evidence that the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2B receptor (5HT2BR) activation and/or increased circulating 5HT (5-hydroxytryptamine) may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of drug-induced valvulopathy. In the present study, we investigated whether 7-day 5HT subcutaneous injections led to structural and compositional abnormalities in conjunction with transcriptomic modulation of 5HT2BR and 5HT transporter (5HTT) genes in the aortic and mitral valves of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Subcutaneous injections of 5HT for 7 days resulted in thickening and compositional alteration of aortic and mitral valves in SD rats. More specifically, valve-leaflets from 5HT-treated rats had greater valve thickness, a higher amount of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and a lower amount of collagen. The compositional alteration was associated with up-regulation and down-regulation of 5HT2BR and 5HTT genes, respectively. The present study strongly suggests that the activation of 5HT2BR and inhibition of 5HTT played a significant role in the pathogenesis of 5HT-induced valvulopathy in SD rats. Thus, these findings further highlight the necessity and/or utilization of animal models to screen potential valvular effects of serotonergic compounds.\n",

      "PMID:  25925909\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a common, frequently disabling, 'functional' condition characterized by recurring, stereotypical attacks of intense nausea, vomiting, and lethargy, with the essential absence of these symptoms between episodes. Although the pathogenesis of CVS is yet unexplained, evidence has accumulated which suggest pathogenic roles for stress-related, autonomic, neuroendocrine, and mitochondrial factors. The objective of this pilot study was to elucidate mechanism(s) by identifying genes involved in the presumed multifactorial pathogenesis of CVS. METHODS: In this pilot study, DNA from 75 unrelated CVS cases and 60 healthy controls were assayed by Courtagen Life Science's next-generation sequencing platform (nucSEEK(™) ), including over 1100 nuclear-encoded genes involved with mitochondria, metabolism, or ion channels. Significant sequence variants were defined as evolutionary conservation at least to Xenopus (frog) per the UCSC Genome Browser. KEY RESULTS: The RYR2 gene, encoding a stress-induced calcium channel present in many neurons, was the only gene demonstrating a statistically significant difference in the proportion of conserved sequence variants among the groups (18/75 CVS, 24%, vs 3/60 controls, 5%; p = 0.0018, OR = 6.0, 95% CI = 1.7-22). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: We propose a mechanism in which RYR2 sequence variants result in aberrant stress-induced calcium release into the mitochondria of autonomic neurons, resulting in an increased risk to develop autonomic/functional disease such as CVS, and related conditions such as migraine and gut dysmotility. This model incorporates the existing hypotheses regarding CVS pathogenesis into a cohesive mechanism, and might have treatment implications.CI - © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n",

      "PMID:  23673147\n",
      "Abs: Migraine is a highly prevalent, disabling and complex episodic brain disorder whose pathogenesis is poorly understood, due in part to the lack of valid animal models. Here we report behavioral evidence of hallmark migraine features, photophobia and unilateral head pain, in transgenic knock-in mice bearing human familial hemiplegic migraine, type 1 (FHM-1) gain-of-function missense mutations (R192Q or S218L) in the Cacna1a gene encoding the CaV2.1 calcium channel α1 subunit. Photophobia was demonstrated using a modified elevated plus maze in which the safe closed arms were brightly illuminated; mutant mice avoided the light despite showing no differences in the standard (anxiety) version of the test. Multiple behavioral measures suggestive of spontaneous head pain were found in 192Q mutants subjected to novelty and/or restraint stress. These behaviors were: (1) more frequent in mutant versus wildtype mice; (2) lateralized in mutant but not in wildtype mice; (3) more frequent in females versus males; and (4) dose-dependently normalized by systemic administration of 2 different acute analgesics, rizatriptan and morphine. Furthermore, some of these behaviors were found to be more frequent and severe in 218L compared to 192Q mutants, consistent with the clinical presentation in humans. We suggest that Cacna1a transgenic mice can experience migraine-related head pain and can thus serve as unique tools to study the pathogenesis of migraine and test novel antimigraine agents.CI - Copyright © 2013 International Association for the Study of Pain.

      "PMID:  9225282\n",
      "Abs: The anti-migraine compound, sumatriptan, has been shown to have substantial affinity for the cloned human 5-HT1F receptor suggesting that, in addition to 5-HT1B/5-HT1D receptor subtypes, the 5-HT1F receptor may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of migraine. Several investigators have used the guinea pig plasma extravasation model to evaluate potential anti-migraine drugs. Since species differences in the pharmacology of serotonin receptors are well known, we compared the pharmacological profiles of the cloned human and guinea pig 5-HT1F receptors in order to validate the usefulness of the in vivo model in predicting anti-migraine activity of compounds targeted for humans. We have cloned the guinea pig 5-HT1F by homology to the human 5-HT1F receptor and evaluated its pharmacological profile using radioligand binding assays. The cloned guinea pig 5-HT1F gene exhibited 94% amino acid identity to the corresponding human homolog. High affinity (Kd approximately 10 nM) [3H]5-HT binding was detected to membranes obtained from Cos-7 cells transiently expressing the guinea pig 5-HT1F receptor. The cloned guinea pig receptor displayed typical 5-HT1F receptor pharmacology with the following rank order of binding affinities: 5-HT > sumatriptan > 1-NP = DHE > alpha-methyl 5-HT > metergoline > methiothepin > 5-CT. The pharmacological profiles of the cloned guinea pig and human 5-HT1F receptors were very similar as reflected by the high correlation (r2 = 0.72, slope = 0.76) observed between the binding affinities of compounds for these two species homologs. In situ hybridization studies in guinea pig tissue revealed 5-HT1F receptor mRNA expression in the neurons of the trigeminal ganglion, suggesting that the 5-HT1F receptor may play a role in the presynaptic inhibition of neuropeptide release at the level of the intracranial vasculature, thereby blocking the development of neurogenic inflammation. Dorsal root ganglion cells also moderately expressed the 5-HT1F transcripts. The localization of the 5-HT1F receptor to areas involved in the mediation and transfer of nociceptive information implies a role for this receptor in pain processing. These findings indicate that a selective 5-HT1F agonist may be a novel approach to treat migraine.\n",

      "PMID:  12970078\n",
      "Abs: 1. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a potent vasodilator released from capsaicin-sensitive trigeminal sensory nerves, seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of migraine. Hence, CGRP receptor antagonists may serve as a novel treatment for migraine. This study was therefore designed to investigate the effects of BIBN4096BS (100, 300 and 1000 microg kg-1, i.v.), a potent and selective CGRP receptor antagonist, on capsaicin-induced carotid haemodynamic changes in anaesthetised pigs. Both vagosympathetic trunks were cut and phenylephrine was infused into the carotid artery (i.c.) to support carotid vascular tone. 2. Infusions of capsaicin (0.3, 1, 3 and 10 microg kg-1 min-1, i.c.) did not alter the heart rate, but dose-dependently increased the mean arterial blood pressure. This moderate hypertensive effect was not modified by BIBN4096BS. 3. Capsaicin infusion (10 microg kg-1 min-1, i.c.) increased total carotid, arteriovenous anastomotic and tissue blood flows and conductances as well as carotid pulsations, but decreased the difference between arterial and jugular venous oxygen saturations. These responses to capsaicin were dose-dependently blocked by BIBN4096BS. 4. Capsaicin infusion (10 microg kg-1 min-1, i.c.) more than doubled the jugular venous plasma concentration of CGRP. This effect was not blocked, but rather increased, by BIBN4096BS. 5. The above results show that BIBN4096BS behaves as a potent antagonist of capsaicin-induced carotid haemodynamic changes that are mediated via the release of CGRP. Therefore, this compound may prove effective in the treatment of migraine.\n",

      "PMID:  11755165\n",
      "Abs: Several lines of evidence suggest that a calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist may serve as a novel abortive migraine treatment. Here we present data on a human cell line and isolated human vessels for such an antagonist, BIBN4096BS. On SK-N-MC membranes, radiolabelled CGRP was displaced by both CGRP-(8-37) and BIBN4096BS, yielding pK(i) values of 8.5 and 11.4, respectively. Functional studies with SK-N-MC cells demonstrated that CGRP-induced cAMP production was antagonised by both CGRP-(8-37) and BIBN4096BS with pA(2) values of 7.8 and 11.2, respectively. Isolated human cerebral, coronary, and omental arteries were studied with a sensitive myograph technique. CGRP induced a concentration-dependent relaxation that was antagonized by both CGRP-(8-37) and BIBN4096BS in a competitive manner. CGRP was a weaker agonist on coronary arteries as compared to intracranial arteries; however, BIBN4096BS was an equally effective antagonist. In human omental arteries, CGRP did not induce relaxation. BIBN4096 had a pA(2) value of 10.1 in cerebral and 10.4 in coronary arteries. The results of clinical trials with BIBN4096BS for acute migraine attacks are awaited with great interest.\n",

      "Abs: INTRODUCTION: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a neuronal messenger in intracranial sensory nerves and is considered to play a significant role in migraine pathophysiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the effect of the CGRP receptor antagonist, telcagepant, on CGRP-induced cranial vasodilatation in human isolated cerebral and middle meningeal arteries. We also studied the expression of the CGRP receptor components in cranial arteries with immunocytochemistry. Concentration response curves to αCGRP were performed in human isolated cerebral and middle meningeal arteries in the absence or presence of telcagepant. Arterial slices were stained for RAMP1, CLR and actin in a double immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: In both arteries, we found that: (i) telcagepant was devoid of any contractile or relaxant effects per se; (ii) pretreatment with telcagepant antagonised the αCGRP-induced relaxation in a competitive manner; and (iii) immunohistochemistry revealed expression and co-localisation of CLR and RAMP1 in the smooth muscle cells in the media layer of both arteries. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide morphological and functional data on the presence of CGRP receptors in cerebral and meningeal arteries, which illustrates a possible site of action of telcagepant in the treatment of migraine.\n",

      "PMID:  15184615\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: To examine the relative importance of genetic and environmental influence for the development of tension-type headache by analyses of twins. METHODS: The authors screened by questionnaire a population of 5,360 twins born during 1953 to 1960 from the general population for migraine and headache symptoms. The response rate of the questionnaire was 87%. All twin pairs with at least one twin of the pair reporting migraine or headache symptoms were interviewed by telephone by a physician. Correlation of liability and structural equation modeling were applied on tension-type headache. RESULTS: A total of 1,417 subjects had tension-type headache equivalent to a 1-year prevalence of 62%. The male: female ratio was 1:1.24. Chronic tension-type headache was found in 49 twins corresponding to a prevalence of 2% with a male:female ratio of 1:1.21. The prevalence, pain characteristics, frequency, and duration of tension-type headache were similar to what has been found in the general Danish population. The correlation of liability of tension-type headache was low and not significantly different in monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs: 0.21 (0.03 to 0.39), 0.08 (0 to 0.24). The best fitting model of phenotypic variation consisted of 81% non-shared environmental effects and of 19% additive genetic effects. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental influence is of major importance for episodic tension-type headache and a genetic factor, if it exits, is minor. In chronic tension-type headache the genetic factor may be more important. These data clearly separate episodic tension-type headache from migraine without aura where the phenotypic variation consists of non-shared environmental effects of 39% and of 61% additive genetic effects.\n",

      "Abs: INTRODUCTION: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a rare hereditary stroke disorder caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene. We report the first Chilean CADASIL family with complete radiological and histological studies. METHODS: The family tree was constructed from an autopsy-confirmed confirmed patient, and includes 3 generations. We performed clinical, pathologic, genetic, and radiologic examinations on members of a family with CADASIL. RESULTS: In the second generation, findings compatible with CADASIL were identified in 6 individuals, all of whom had a missense mutation in exon 3 (c.268C>T) resulting in an arginine to cysteine amino acid substitution at position 90 (R90C). In the third generation, a missense mutation was detected in one of the 4 asymptomatic individuals. CONCLUSIONS: There are similarities in clinical presentation between this family and previously described Asian and European series with R90C mutations. Detecting genotypes with a gain or loss of cysteine residues opens the door to future gene transfection-based therapies.CI - Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Abs: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a hereditary microangiopathy with adult onset caused by a missense mutation in the NOTCH3 gene in chromosome 19p13. It presents with autosomal dominant arteriopathy, subcortical infarctions, and leukoencephalopathy. Its common clinical presentations are seen as recurrent strokes, migraine or migraine-like headaches, progressive dementia, pseudobulbar paralysis, and psychiatric conditions. Two patients with CADASIL syndrome, whose diagnosis was made based on clinical course, age of onset, imaging findings, and genetic assays in the patients and family members, are presented here because of new familial polymorphisms. The first patient, with cerebellar and psychotic findings, had widespread non-confluent hyperintense lesions as well as moderate cerebellar atrophy in cranial magnetic resonance scanning. The other patient, with headache, dizziness, and forgetfulness, had gliotic lesions in both cerebral hemispheres. CADASIL gene studies revealed a new polymorphism in exon 33 in the first patient. In the other patient, the NOTCH3 gene was identified as a new variant of p.H243P (c.728A > C heterozygous). By reporting a family presenting with various clinical symptoms in the presence of new polymorphisms, we emphasize that CADASIL syndrome may present with various clinical courses and should be considered in differential diagnoses.\n",

      "PMID:  17440989\n",
      "Abs: Cavernous vascular malformations may affect brain and out-of-brain tissues. In most cases, cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) involve the brain alone, and are rarely associated with skin hemangiomas, spinal cord, retinal, hepatic or vertebral lesions. CCMs can cause seizures, intracranial and spinal haemorrhages, focal neurological deficits, and migraine-like headaches. After collecting CCM families of Italian origin and investigating the genetic basis of the disorder we disclosed two novel molecular variations in the KRIT1 and MGC4607 genes. We found a novel CCM1 gene mutation (Q66X) in a family with apparently asymptomatic old-aged mutation carriers and patients who either had skin angiomas alone or the full association of cerebral, spinal, and skin lesions. In this family we report the highest variability in mutation penetrance so far described, including the presence of CCM in one subject since birth (surgery at 19 months of age), a condition to our knowledge so far unreported. In a CCM2 affected family, we also report a novel causative mutation, (54_55delAC) in exon 2 of the MGC4607 gene, that produces a truncated protein containing only 22 amino acids. These data describe novel CCM mutations associated with a particularly high variability of the penetrance causing, in some cases, reduced expression of clinical symptoms and sporadic cases with apparent negative family history. Hence they emphasize the importance of DNA-based diagnostics and genetic counseling to identify unaffected mutation carriers subjects, even at advanced age.\n",

      "Abs: Dysregulation of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a potent vasodilator, is directly implicated in the pathogenesis of migraine. CGRP binds to and signals through the CGRP receptor (CGRP-R), a heterodimer containing the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR), a class B GPCR, and RAMP1, a receptor activity-modifying protein. We have solved the crystal structure of the CLR/RAMP1 N-terminal ectodomain heterodimer, revealing how RAMPs bind to and potentially modulate the activities of the CLR GPCR subfamily. We also report the structures of CLR/RAMP1 in complex with the clinical receptor antagonists olcegepant (BIBN4096BS) and telcagepant (MK0974). Both drugs act by blocking access to the peptide-binding cleft at the interface of CLR and RAMP1. These structures illustrate, for the first time, how small molecules bind to and modulate the activity of a class B GPCR, and highlight the challenges of designing potent receptor antagonists for the treatment of migraine and other class B GPCR-related diseases.CI - Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

      "PMID:  30535790\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a 37-amino acid neuropeptide expressed both centrally and peripherally. CGRP has been shown to be involved in arteriolar dilation, cardiovascular regulation, pain transmission, migraine, and gastrointestinal physiology. Our current research is aimed at analyzing CGRP's impact on appetite/satiety, body metabolism, and energy homeostasis. Our study investigated the effects of a single-dose intraperitoneal (IP) treatment with CGRP on food and water consumption, energy expenditure, physical activity, respirometry, and a panel of plasma metabolic hormones in C57Bl/6 wild-type (WT) mice. After a CGRP IP injection at a dose of 2 nmol (10 μM CGRP in 200 μl of saline), a significant reduction in food intake and metabolic parameters as RQ, VCO(2), and VO(2) was observed. CGRP-injected mice had also significantly lower total energy expenditure (TEE) with no changes in activity levels compared to vehicle-injected controls. CGRP treatment in mice induced significantly lower plasma levels of glucagon and leptin but higher levels of amylin. Our data show that a single dose of CGRP peptide significantly decreased food consumption and altered calorimetric parameters and plasma metabolic hormone levels, thus confirming that CGRP plays a pivotal role in the regulation of appetite and metabolism. Future studies are necessary to analyze CGRP's long-term impact on body metabolism and its potential effects on appetite, obesity, and metabolic disorders.\n",

      "Abs: Primary dysmenorrhoea, defined as painful menstrual cramps in the absence of pelvic pathology, is a common problem in women of reproductive age. Its aetiology and pathophysiology remain largely unknown. Here we performed a two-stage genome-wide association study and subsequent replication study to identify genetic factors associated with primary dysmenorrhoea in a total of 6,770 Chinese individuals. Our analysis provided evidence of a significant (P<5 × 10(-8)) association at rs76518691 in the gene ZMIZ1 and at rs7523831 near NGF. ZMIZ1 has previously been associated with several autoimmune diseases, and NGF plays a key role in the generation of pain and hyperalgesia and has been associated with migraine. These findings provide future directions for research on susceptibility mechanisms for primary dysmenorrhoea. Furthermore, our genetic architecture analysis provides molecular support for the heritability and polygenic nature of this condition.\n",

      "PMID:  22190617\n",
      "Abs: Familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM-1), a rare hereditary form of migraine with aura and hemiparesis, serves as a good model for exploring migraine pathophysiology. The FHM-1 gene encodes the pore-forming Ca(V)2.1 subunit of human P/Q-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels (VGCCs). Some FHM-1 mutations result in a decrease of whole cell P/Q-type current density in transfected cells/neurons. Questions remain as to whether and how these mutations may increase the gain of the trigeminal nociceptive pathway underlying migraine headache. Here, we investigated the effects of T666M, the most frequently occurring FHM-1 mutation, on VGCC currents and neuronal excitability in trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons. We expressed human wild-type and T666M Ca(V)2.1 subunits in cultured TG neurons from Ca(V)2.1 knockout mice and recorded whole cell VGCC currents in transfected neurons. Currents mediated by individual VGCC subtypes were dissected according to their pharmacological and biophysical properties. TG neurons were sorted into three subpopulations based on their soma size and their affinity to isolectin B4 (IB4). We found that the T666M mutation did not affect total or surface expression of Ca(V)2.1 proteins but caused a profound reduction of P/Q-type current in all subtypes of TG neurons. Interestingly, a compensatory increase in Ca(V)3.2-mediated low-voltage-activated T-type currents only occurred in small IB4-negative (IB4(-)) TG neurons expressing T666M subunits. Current-clamp recordings showed that the T666M mutation resulted in hyperexcitability of the small IB4(-) TG population. Taken together, our results suggest a possible scenario through which FHM-1 mutations might increase the gain of the trigeminal nociceptive pathway.\n",

      "Abs: Defining the role of calcitonin gene-related peptide in migraine pathogenesis could lead to the application of calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists as novel migraine therapeutics. In this work, quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling of biological activities of a large range of calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists was performed using a panel of physicochemical descriptors. The computational studies evaluated different variable selection techniques and demonstrated shuffling stepwise multiple linear regression to be superior over genetic algorithm-multiple linear regression. The linear quantitative structure-activity relationship model revealed better statistical parameters of cross-validation in comparison with the non-linear support vector regression technique. Implementing only five peptide descriptors into this linear quantitative structure-activity relationship model resulted in an extremely robust and highly predictive model with calibration, leave-one-out and leave-20-out validation R(2) of 0.9194, 0.9103, and 0.9214, respectively. We performed docking of the most potent calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists with the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor and demonstrated that peptide antagonists act by blocking access to the peptide-binding cleft. We also demonstrated the direct contact of residues 28-37 of the calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists with the receptor. These results are in agreement with the conclusions drawn from the quantitative structure-activity relationship model, indicating that both electrostatic and steric factors should be taken into account when designing novel calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists.CI - © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.\n",

      "PMID:  22056601\n",
      "Abs: Migraine headaches are more prevalent in women and often occur during the early phases of the menstrual cycle, implying a link between migraine and ovarian steroids. Serotonin (5-HT) and its receptors have been proposed to play a key role in the pathophysiology of migraine. The trigeminal ganglion (TG) has been proposed as a site for 5-HT synthesis based on the expression of the rate limiting enzyme in peripheral 5-HT synthesis, tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1), in female rodent trigeminal ganglia. Tryptophan hydroxylase levels vary over the estrus cycle, however, the expression and potential regulation of other enzymes involved in 5-HT synthesis has not been reported in this tissue. C57/BL6 mice of both sexes expressed TPH1 and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), the key enzymes involved in 5-HT synthesis. Levels of both enzymes were significantly higher in juvenile males compared with females. In naturally cycling females TPH1 and AADC expression was highest during proestrus when compared with the other phases of the cycle, and this regulation was mirrored at the mRNA level. In situ hybridization experiments detected TPH1 and AADC mRNA in presumptive neurons in the trigeminal ganglion. Both key enzymes involved in the synthesis of 5-HT are expressed in mouse trigeminal ganglion and are localized to neurons. The levels of these enzymes are dependent on gender and estrus cycle stage, suggesting that ovarian steroids might play a role in the regulation of sensory neuron 5-HT synthesis.CI - Copyright © 2011 IBRO.

      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: Neuronal channelopathies cause brain disorders, including epilepsy, migraine, and ataxia. Despite the development of mouse models, pathophysiological mechanisms for these disorders remain uncertain. One particularly devastating channelopathy is Dravet syndrome (DS), a severe childhood epilepsy typically caused by de novo dominant mutations in the SCN1A gene encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel Na(v) 1.1. Heterologous expression of mutant channels suggests loss of function, raising the quandary of how loss of sodium channels underlying action potentials produces hyperexcitability. Mouse model studies suggest that decreased Na(v) 1.1 function in interneurons causes disinhibition. We aim to determine how mutant SCN1A affects human neurons using the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) method to generate patient-specific neurons. METHODS: Here we derive forebrain-like pyramidal- and bipolar-shaped neurons from 2 DS subjects and 3 human controls by iPSC reprogramming of fibroblasts. DS and control iPSC-derived neurons are compared using whole-cell patch clamp recordings. Sodium current density and intrinsic neuronal excitability are examined. RESULTS: Neural progenitors from DS and human control iPSCs display a forebrain identity and differentiate into bipolar- and pyramidal-shaped neurons. DS patient-derived neurons show increased sodium currents in both bipolar- and pyramidal-shaped neurons. Consistent with increased sodium currents, both types of patient-derived neurons show spontaneous bursting and other evidence of hyperexcitability. Sodium channel transcripts are not elevated, consistent with a post-translational mechanism. INTERPRETATION: These data demonstrate that epilepsy patient-specific iPSC-derived neurons are useful for modeling epileptic-like hyperactivity. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized cell-autonomous epilepsy mechanism potentially underlying DS, and offer a platform for screening new antiepileptic therapies.CI - © 2013 American Neurological Association.\n",

      "PMID:  9596355\n",
      "Abs: Electrical stimulation of the superior sagittal sinus is an experimental model of migraine which activates neurons within the upper cervical spinal cord. The ventrolateral periaqueductal gray has been proposed as an integrative centre for the autonomic and behavioural responses to deep pain and also receives significant inputs from the upper cervical spinal cord. The noxious-stimulation evoked expression of the immediate-early gene c-fos, was used to determine if sagittal sinus stimulation activates neurons of the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray. The superior sagittal sinus was stimulated in anesthetised cats and Fos-protein was detected in coronal brain sections using standard avidin-biotin immunohistochemistry. A pattern of Fos-positive cells restricted to the caudal ventrolateral periaqueductal gray was revealed suggesting that this region may mediate the pattern of somatic and autonomic responses characteristic of migraine.\n",

      "PMID:  31146726\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a hereditary arteriopathy associated with the NOTCH3 gene. Clinical manifestations include strokes, transient ischaemic events, psychiatric disturbances, dementia, and migraines. We report a case of a Thai man with a severe CADASIL phenotype who presented with recurrent seizures and acute ischaemic stroke and classic vascular risk factors. CASE PRESENTATION: A 50-year-old man with a history of mood disorder and progressive cognitive decline for 20 years as well as well-controlled diabetes mellitus and hypertension presented with recurrent generalized seizures and acute right-sided weakness. An MRI of the brain showed acute infarction of the left pons, a large number of cerebral microbleeds throughout the brain and white matter abnormalities without classic anterior temporal lobe lesions. Molecular genetic testing identified a homozygous pathologic variant, c.1672C > T (p. Arg558Cys), in the NOTCH3 gene. The diagnosis of CADASIL was confirmed. His clinical symptoms deteriorated, and he died of tracheobronchitis with secretion obstruction. CONCLUSION: This case raises awareness of an uncommon cause of acute ischaemic stroke in patients with classic vascular risk factors and emphasizes the need for a complete evaluation in cases with unexpected clinical presentation or unexpected diagnostic study results.\n",

      "PMID:  26149232\n",
      "Abs: Endogenous NO and hydrogen sulfide form HNO, which causes CGRP release via TRPA1 channel activation in sensory nerves. In the present study, stimulation of intact trigeminal afferent neuron preparations with NO donors, Na2S or both was analyzed by measuring CGRP release as an index of mass activation. Combined stimulation was able to activate all parts of the trigeminal system and acted synergistic compared to stimulation with both substances alone. To investigate the contribution of both substances, we varied their ratio and tracked intracellular calcium in isolated neurons. Our results demonstrate that hydrogen sulfide is the rate-limiting factor for HNO formation. CGRP has a key role in migraine pathophysiology and HNO formation at all sites of the trigeminal system should be considered for this novel means of activation.CI - Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

      "Abs: We report a 12-year-old female patient with a mild phenotype of glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome (Glut1D). The clinical picture was characterized by refractory absence epilepsy, migraine, and learning disabilities. Absence seizures appeared at the age of 4 years, and electroencephalogram (EEG) showed irregular discharges of diffuse epileptic abnormalities. During the follow-up, seizures became drug resistant, cognitive evaluation revealed learning difficulties, and the patient complained migraine episodes. The evidence of seizure worsening before meals and the drug resistance suggested a Glut1D. Molecular analysis of SLC2A1 gene showed the presence of a pathogenic de novo mutation of the gene in heterozygosity (p.Ala275Thr, c.823G > A). Our case and the review of literature data on patients with Glut1D and absences provide a combination of clinical and EEG keys that should prompt the genetic analysis. The Glut1D should be suspected when absence seizures are associated with at least one among: irregular ictal EEG discharges, mild mental retardation, migraine, microcephaly, drug resistance, and worsening during fasting. An early diagnosis allows to establish one of the available ketogenic regimens which could modify the natural history of this treatable condition.CI - Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.\n",

      "Title: Two novel alleles of tottering with distinct Ca(v)2.1 calcium channel neuropathologies\n",
      "PMID:  18597946\n",
      "Abs: The calcium channel CACNA1A gene encodes the pore-forming, voltage-sensitive subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium Ca(v)2.1 type channel. Mutations in this gene have been linked to several human disorders, including familial hemiplegic migraine, episodic ataxia 2 and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6. The mouse homologue, Cacna1a, is associated with the tottering, Cacna1a(tg), mutant series. Here we describe two new missense mutant alleles, Cacna1a(tg-4J) and Cacna1a(Tg-5J). The Cacna1a(tg-4J) mutation is a valine to alanine mutation at amino acid 581, in segment S5 of domain II. The recessive Cacna1a(tg-4J) mutant exhibited the ataxia, paroxysmal dyskinesia and absence seizures reminiscent of the original tottering mouse. The Cacna1a(tg-4J) mutant also showed altered activation and inactivation kinetics of the Ca(v)2.1 channel, not previously reported for other tottering alleles. The semi-dominant Cacna1a(Tg-5J) mutation changed a conserved arginine residue to glutamine at amino acid 1252 within segment S4 of domain III. The heterozygous mouse was ataxic and homozygotes rarely survived. The Cacna1a(Tg-5J) mutation caused a shift in both voltage activation and inactivation to lower voltages, showing that this arginine residue is critical for sensing Ca(v)2.1 voltage changes. These two tottering mouse models illustrate how novel allelic variants can contribute to functional studies of the Ca(v)2.1 calcium channel.\n",

      "PMID:  15237097\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is released into the cranial circulation of humans during acute migraine. To determine whether CGRP is involved in neurotransmission in craniovascular nociceptive pathways, we microiontophoresed onto neurons in the trigeminocervical complex and intravenously administered the CGRP receptor antagonists alpha-CGRP-(8-37) and BIBN4096BS. Cats were anaesthetised with alpha-chloralose, and using halothane during surgical preparation. A craniotomy and C1/C2 laminectomy allowed access to the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and recording site. Recordings of activity in the trigeminocervical complex evoked by electrical stimulation of the SSS were made. Multibarrelled micropipettes incorporating a recording electrode were used for microiontophoresis of test substances. Cells recorded received wide dynamic range (WDR) or nociceptive specific (NS) input from cutaneous receptive fields on the face or forepaws. Cell firing was increased to 25-30 Hz by microiontophoresis of L-glutamate (n = 43 cells). Microiontophoresis of alpha-CGRP excited seven of 17 tested neurons. BIBN4096BS inhibited the majority of units (26 of 38 cells) activated by l-glutamate, demonstrating a non-presynaptic site of action for CGRP. alpha-CGRP-(8-37) inhibited a similar proportion of units (five of nine cells). Intravenous BIBN4096BS resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of trigeminocervical SSS-evoked activity (ED50 31 microg kg(-1)). The maximal effect observed within 30 min of administration. The data suggest that there are non-presynaptic CGRP receptors in the trigeminocervical complex that can be inhibited by CGRP receptor blockade and that a CGRP receptor antagonist would be effective in the acute treatment of migraine and cluster headache.CI - Copyright 2004 Nature Publishing Group\n",

      "PMID:  26111800\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies have identified TRPM8 (transient receptor potential melastatin 8) as one of the susceptibility genes for common migraine. Here, we investigated the postnatal changes of TRPM8-expressing dural afferent fibers as well as the function of dural TRPM8 channels in mice. RESULTS: First, we quantified the density and the number of axonal branches of TRPM8-expressing fibers in the dura of mice expressing farnesylated enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFPf) from one TRPM8 allele between postnatal day 2 (P2) to adulthood. The number of axonal branches on individual dural EGFP-positive fibers was decreased by 30% between P2 and P11. The density of dural EGFP-positive fibers was subsequently reduced by 50% between P16 and P21. Conversely, the density and the number of branches of axons expressing calcitonin gene-related peptide remained stable in postnatal mouse dura. The density of TRPM8-expressing fibers innervating the mouse cornea epithelium was significantly increased from P2 to adulthood. Next, we tested the function of dural TRPM8 channels in adult mice and found that TRPM8 agonist menthol effectively inhibited the nocifensive behavior evoked by dural application of inflammatory mediators. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the TRPM8-expressing dural afferent fibers undergo cell- and target tissue-specific axonal pruning during postnatal development. Activation of dural TRPM8 channels decreases meningeal irritation-evoked nocifensive behavior in adult mice. This provides a framework to further explore the role of postnatal changes of TRPM8-expressing dural afferents in the pathophysiology of pediatric and adult migraine.\n",

      "PMID:  23171280\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Enhanced activity of trigeminal ganglion neurons is thought to underlie neuronal sensitization facilitating the onset of chronic pain attacks, including migraine. Recurrent headache attacks might establish a chronic neuroinflammatory ganglion profile contributing to the hypersensitive phenotype. Since it is difficult to study this process in vivo, we investigated functional crosstalk between macrophages and sensory neurons in primary cultures from trigeminal sensory ganglia of wild-type (WT) or knock-in (KI) mice expressing the Cacna1a gene mutation (R192Q) found in familial hemiplegic migraine-type 1. After studying the number and morphology of resident macrophages in culture, the consequences of adding host macrophages on macrophage phagocytosis and membrane currents mediated by pain-transducing P2X3 receptors on sensory neurons were examined. RESULTS: KI ganglion cultures constitutively contained a larger number of active macrophages, although no difference in P2X3 receptor expression was found. Co-culturing WT or KI ganglia with host macrophages (active as much as resident cells) strongly stimulated single cell phagocytosis. The same protocol had no effect on P2X3 receptor expression in WT or KI co-cultures, but it largely enhanced WT neuron currents that grew to the high amplitude constitutively seen for KI neurons. No further potentiation of KI neuronal currents was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Trigeminal ganglion cultures from a genetic mouse model of migraine showed basal macrophage activation together with enhanced neuronal currents mediated by P2X3 receptors. This phenotype could be replicated in WT cultures by adding host macrophages, indicating an important functional crosstalk between macrophages and sensory neurons.\n",

      "PMID:  31513838\n",
      "Abs: ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Chuanxiong Rhizoma and Cyperi Rhizoma (CRCR), an ancient and classic herbal pair, has been used in herbal medicines for treating migraine, but its effective components are not clear. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study aimed to identify and quantify the quality markers and anti-migraine active components in CRCR based on chemometric analysis between chemical constituents and pharmacological effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The HPLC fingerprints of eight batches of CRCR samples were obtained, and their characteristic common peaks were identified by HPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS. The therapeutic effects of eight batches of CRCR samples on nitroglycerin-induced migraine rats were evaluated by migraine-related neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Similarity analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis were applied to screen the quality markers. Artificial neural network and partial least squares regression models were used to screen the anti-migraine compounds by correlating the chemical constituents in HPLC fingerprints and pharmacological indicators. RESULTS: Eighteen characteristic common peaks were found in the HPLC fingerprints, including eleven known compounds and seven unknown compounds. Ferulic acid (FA), senkyunolide I (SI), senkyunolide A (SA), 3-n-butylphthalide (NBP), Z-ligustilide (LIG), Z-3-butylidenephthalide (BDPH), nookatone (NKT), levistilide A (LA), α-cyperone (CYP) and other five unknown compounds (P1, P2, P7, P8 and P9) were identified as quality markers. SA, NBP, LIG, NKT, CYP and other three unknown compounds (P1, P4 and P9) can be considered as anti-migraine prototype compounds. The quality markers and anti-migraine active components were further quantified in CRCR extract, rat serum and cerebral cortex by UPLC-MS/MS, which gives a clue to track the dynamic changes of the contents of the main constituents. CONCLUSIONS: Our study explored the anti-migraine material basis, and could lay a foundation for the improvement of the quality control of CRCR in practice.CI - Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

      "PMID:  30146940\n",
      "Abs: Objective Previous studies of neuropathic pain have suggested that the P2X4 purinoceptor (P2X4R) in spinal microglia is essential for maintaining allodynia following nerve injury. However, little is known about its role in inflammatory soup-induced trigeminal allodynia, which closely mimics chronic migraine status. Here, we determined the contributions of P2X4R and related signaling pathways in an inflammatory soup-induced trigeminal allodynia model. Methods P2X4R gene and protein levels in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis were analyzed following repeated dural inflammatory soup infusions. p38, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, excitatory amino acid transporter 3, c-Fos, and calcitonin gene-related peptide protein levels in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, as well as trigeminal sensitivity, were assessed among the different groups. Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect protein localization and expression in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. Results Repeated inflammatory dural stimulation induced trigeminal hyperalgesia and the upregulation of P2X4R. Immunofluorescence revealed that P2X4R was expressed in trigeminal nucleus caudalis microglial cells. Blockage of P2X4R produced an anti-nociceptive effect, which was associated with an inhibition of inflammatory soup-induced increases in p38, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, excitatory amino acid transporter 3, c-Fos, and calcitonin gene-related peptide protein levels. The tyrosine receptor kinase B antagonist ANA-12 reversed trigeminal allodynia and the upregulation of excitatory amino acid transporter 3, c-Fos, and calcitonin gene-related peptide, whereas the agonist 7,8-dihydroxyflavone exacerbated these effects. Double immunostaining indicated that p38 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor were mainly expressed in microglial cells, whereas excitatory amino acid transporter 3 was primarily expressed in trigeminal nucleus caudalis neurons. Conclusions These data indicate that microglial P2X4R is involved in the regulation of excitatory amino acid transporter 3 via brain-derived neurotrophic factor-tyrosine receptor kinase B signaling following repeated inflammatory dural stimulation. Microglial P2X4R activation and microglia-neuron interactions in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis may play a role in the pathogenesis of migraine chronicity, and the modulation of P2X4R activation might be a potential therapeutic strategy.\n",

      "Abs: Although it is still debated whether vasoconstriction underlies migraine resolution by triptans, they are not recommended in patients at cardiovascular risk. However, relationship between stroke incidence and triptan use is unclear, and it is unknown whether acute or chronic use of these drugs worsens ischemic brain injury. To address this issue, we investigated the effect of clinically-relevant doses of the potent cerebral artery vasoconstrictor eletriptan on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and brain infarct volumes, as well as on expression of genes involved in cerebrovascular regulation. We report that acute treatment of rats or mice with eletriptan did not reduce basal CBF, which promptly dropped upon treatment with prazosin or dihydroergotamine. Acute of chronic (1month) eletriptan also did not affect CBF changes and infarct volumes in mice undergoing brain ischemia/reperfusion. Finally, chronic eletriptan reduced brain mRNAs for PACAP and VIP, leaving unaffected those for 5HT1(B/D)R and CGRP. No significant transcript changes were found in dura mater. Data suggest that the impact of triptans on cerebral hemodynamic should be re-evaluated, as well as their propensity to increase stroke risk in migraineurs.CI - Copyright © 2016 IBRO.

      "PMID:  16485903\n",
      "Abs: The widely used antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA), which is also used in migraine prophylaxis and the treatment of bipolar disorders, is also under trial as an anticancer agent. Despite its wide range of therapeutic applications, VPA also has two severe side effects: acute liver toxicity and teratogenicity. The mechanism of action for all these properties is unknown to date, but recently, it was shown that VPA is able to inhibit the enzyme class of histone deacetylases (HDACs), proteins with a fundamental impact on gene expression and therefore possible molecular targets of VPA-induced signaling cascades. The purpose of this study was to determine if teratogenic side effects of VPA could be linked to its HDAC inhibition ability by studying a large set of structurally diverse derivatives based on the VPA core structure. We demonstrate that only VPA derivatives with a teratogenic potential in mice are able to induce a hyperacetylation in core histone H4 in teratocarcinoma F9 cells. We also demonstrate that this marker of functional HDAC inhibition occurs almost immediately (15 min) after exposure of F9 cells to VPA, whereas no influence on the HDAC protein levels (HDAC 2 and HDAC 3) could be detected even after 24 h of treatment. Further measurement of the IC50(HDAC) values of VPA derivatives in a human HDAC enzyme test system revealed an activity range from 10 to 10 000 microM; in some derivatives, HDAC inhibition ability was 40 times that of VPA. We also show a quantitative correlation between the IC50(HDAC) and the teratogenic potential of VPA derivatives, which clearly points toward HDACs as the formerly described teratogenic receptors of VPA-induced neural tube defects (NTDs).\n",

      "PMID:  22289052\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: To understand a possible role for transient potential receptor vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) ion channels in sumatriptan relief of pain mediated by trigeminal nociceptors. BACKGROUND: TRPV1 channels are expressed in small nociceptive sensory neurons. In dorsal root ganglia, TRPV1-containing nociceptors mediate certain types of inflammatory pain. Neurogenic inflammation of cerebral dura and blood vessels in the trigeminal nociceptive system is thought to be important in migraine pain, but the ion channels important in transducing migraine pain are not known. Sumatriptan is an agent effective in treatment of migraine and cluster headache. We hypothesized that sumatriptan might modulate activity of TRPV1 channels found in the trigeminal nociceptive system. METHODS: We used immunohistochemistry to detect the presence of TRPV1 channel protein, whole-cell recording in acutely dissociated trigeminal ganglia (TG) to detect functionality of TRPV1 channels, and whole-cell recording in trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) to detect effects on release of neurotransmitters from trigeminal neurons onto second order sensory neurons. Effects specifically on TG neurons that project to cerebral dura were assessed by labeling dural nociceptors with DiI. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that TRPV1 channels are present in cerebral dura, in trigeminal ganglion, and in the TNC. Capsaicin, a TRPV1 agonist, produced depolarization and repetitive action potential firing in current clamp recordings, and large inward currents in voltage clamp recordings from acutely dissociated TG neurons, demonstrating that TRPV1 channels are functional in trigeminal neurons. Capsaicin increased spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents in neurons of layer II in TNC slices, showing that these channels have a physiological effect on central synaptic transmission. Sumatriptan (10 µM), a selective antimigraine drug, inhibited TRPV1-mediated inward currents in TG and capsaicin-elicited spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents in TNC slices. The same effects of capsaicin and sumatriptan were found in acutely dissociated DiI-labeled TG neurons innervating cerebral dura. CONCLUSION: Our results build on previous work indicating that TRPV1 channels in trigeminal nociceptors play a role in craniofacial pain. Our findings that TRPV1 is inhibited by the specific antimigraine drug sumatriptan, and that TRPV1 channels are functional in neurons projecting to cerebral dura suggests a specific role for these channels in migraine or cluster headache.CI - © 2012 American Headache Society.\n",

      "PMID:  16860310\n",
      "Abs: Proper calcium channel and insulin signaling are essential for normal brain development. Leaner mice with a mutation in the P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel, Cacna1a, develop cerebellar atrophy and mutations in the homologous human gene are associated with increased migraine and seizure tendency. Similarly, abnormalities in insulin signaling are associated with abnormal brain growth and migraine tendency. Previously, we have shown that in the ADF chemosensory neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans UNC-2/Ca(2+) channel function affects TGF-beta-dependent developmental regulation of tryptophan hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin synthesis. Here we show that developmental expression of a tryptophan hydroxylase: :GFP reporter construct is similarly decreased by reduction-of-function mutations in the daf-2/insulin receptor. This decreased expression of tryptophan hydroxylase observed in both the daf-2 and unc-2 mutant backgrounds is suppressible either genetically by reduction-of-function mutations in the daf-16/forkhead transcription factor, an effector of the DAF-2/insulin receptor, or pharmacologically by the serotonin receptor antagonist cyproheptadine. Overall, these data suggest that both UNC-2 and DAF-2 function are required in the developmental regulation of DAF-16 and serotonin-dependent inhibition of tryptophan hydroxylase expression.\n",

      "PMID:  20955764\n",
      "Abs: Clinical and genetic studies have suggested a role for voltage gated calcium channels (VGCCs) in the pathogenesis of migraine. Release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from trigeminal neurons has also been implicated in migraine. The VGCCs are located presynaptically on neurons and are involved in the release of these peptides to different stimuli. We have examined the presence and importance of VGCCs in controlling the CGRP release from rat dura mater, freshly isolated trigeminal ganglion (TG) and trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC). Each of the four VGCCs, P/Q-, N-, and L- and T-type are abundantly found in TG and TNC relative to the dura mater and each mediates a significant fraction of high potassium concentration induced CGRP release. In dura mater, blockade of P/Q-, N- and L-type VGCCs by ω-agatoxin TK, ω-conotoxin GVIA and nimodipine at 1 μM respectively, significantly decreased the potassium induced CGRP release. In the absence of calcium ions (Ca2+) and in the presence of a cocktail of blockers, the stimulated CGRP release from dura mater was reduced almost to the same level as basal CGRP release. In the TG ω-conotoxin GVIA inhibited the potassium induced CGRP release significantly. In the absence of Ca2+ and in the presence of a cocktail of blockers the stimulated CGRP release was significantly reduced. In the TNC only the cocktail of blockers and the absence of Ca2+ could reduce the potassium induced release significantly. These results suggest that depolarization by high potassium releases CGRP, and the release is regulated by Ca2+ ions and voltage-gated calcium channels.CI - Copyright © 2011 IBRO.

      "Abs: Release of CGRP during migraine may produce harmful dilatation of cranial arteries, thereby possibly causing pain. We have compared the antagonism by BIBN4096BS and CGRP(8-37) of the relaxant effects of alpha-CGRP on rings of human temporal artery. alpha-CGRP relaxed the arteries precontracted with 9 - 24 mM KCl (-logEC50=9.4) nearly as efficaciously as sodium nitroprusside (10 microM). BIBN4096BS (0.1 - 100 nM) antagonized the effects of alpha-CGRP in surmountable manner with slopes of Schild-plots not different from unity. -LogKB values of 10.1 and 10.4 were estimated for BIBN4096BS when administered before or during the KCl-contracture respectively. BIBN4096BS (1 microM) did not modify the relaxant effects of papaverine and sodium nitroprusside. CGRP(8-37) (1 - 10 microM) antagonized the effects of alpha-CGRP in a surmountable manner with slopes of Schild-plots not different from unity. -LogKB values of 6.6 and 6.7 were estimated for CGRP(8-37) administered before or during the KCl-contracture respectively. The high affinity of BIBN4096BS for CGRP receptors of human temporal artery makes it an excellent tool to explore the hypothesis of CGRP-evoked cerebral vasodilation in migraine.\n",

      "PMID:  7536103\n",
      "Abs: Activation of the trigeminovascular system leads to neurogenic inflammation within the dura mater and cerebral vasodilatation. These processes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of migraine headache. Neurogenic vasodilator responses to trigeminal ganglion stimulation were investigated in rat facial skin, an area innervated by the trigeminal nerve. Microvascular blood flow changes in the facial skin were measured in anaesthetised rats, using laser Doppler flowmetry. Electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion caused an ipsilateral increase in facial skin blood flow which was found to be frequency dependent (0.5-10 Hz). The role of several neuropeptides in these blood flow responses was studied using selective receptor antagonists. The calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonist, CGRP8-37 (400 nmol.kg-1, i.v.) had no effect on resting levels of facial skin blood flow, but markedly inhibited responses induced by trigeminal ganglion stimulation (5 Hz, 10 V, 1 ms for 30 s). However, neither the neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonist, RP67580 (0.23 or 2.3 mumol.kg-1, i.v.) nor the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) antagonist, [p-Cl-D-Phe6,Leu17]-VIP (15 or 30 nmol.kg-1, i.v.) had any effect on these responses. These results suggest that CGRP is the major neuropeptide involved in the vasodilator response to trigeminal ganglion stimulation in rat facial skin. Clarification of the mechanisms involved in this neurogenic vasodilator response may aid the development of drugs that target the trigeminovascular system during migraine headache.\n",

      "PMID:  22803321\n",
      "Abs: L-type calcium channel blockers like verapamil are used in the prophylaxis of migraine. However, their effect on the expression of CGRP in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) is unknown. It is important because an earlier study had shown that olcegepant, a CGRP receptor antagonist, acts at the level of the trigeminal spinal nucleus rather than the trigeminal ganglia. Nimodipine was used in the present study as it crosses the blood-brain barrier. The objective of the study was to determine the pattern of expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the TNC after administration of nimodipine and/or morphine. Wistar rats were injected with saline, morphine, nimodipine or morphine + nimodipine for 14 days. Subsequently, the lowest part of the medulla oblongata containing the spinal nucleus was removed and processed for immunohistochemical localization of CGRP. The density of expression was quantified using Image J software. The results were statistically analyzed. CGRP expression was noted over the superficial part of the TNC, which decreased significantly after nimodipine administration. Conversely, morphine produced an up-regulation. The expression was unchanged with reference to saline in the morphine + nimodipine treated group. Decreased expression of CGRP in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis after nimodipine is being reported for the first time. Also, whether CGRP expression can be used as a marker for predicting the therapeutic efficacy of an anti-migraine drug is currently being investigated.\n",

      "PMID:  31838630\n",
      "Abs: Genetic brain channelopathies result from inherited or de novo mutations of genes encoding ion channel subunits within the central nervous system. Most neurological channelopathies arise in childhood with paroxysmal or episodic symptoms, likely because of a transient impairment of homeostatic mechanisms regulating membrane excitability, and the prototypical expression of this impairment is epilepsy. Migraine, episodic ataxia and alternating hemiplegia can also occur, as well as chronic phenotypes, such as spinocerebellar ataxias, intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Voltage-gated and ligand-gated channels may be involved. In most cases, a single gene may be associated with a phenotypical spectrum that shows variable expressivity. Different clinical features may arise at different ages and the adult phenotype may be remarkably modified from the syndrome onset in childhood or adolescence. Recognizing the prominent phenotypical traits of brain channelopathies is essential to perform appropriate diagnostic investigations and to provide the better care not only in the paediatric setting but also for adult patients and their caregivers. Herein, we provide an overview of genetic brain channelopathies associated with epilepsy, highlight the different molecular mechanisms and describe the different clinical characteristics which may prompt the clinician to suspect specific syndromes and to possibly establish tailored treatments.\n",

      "PMID:  17234593\n",
      "Abs: Several disorders have been associated with mutations in Na,K-ATPase alpha isoforms (rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism, familial hemiplegic migraine type-2), as well as reduction in Na,K-ATPase content (depression and Alzheimer's disease), thereby raising the issue of whether haploinsufficiency or altered enzymatic function contribute to disease etiology. Three isoforms are expressed in the brain: the alpha1 isoform is found in many cell types, the alpha2 isoform is predominantly expressed in astrocytes, and the alpha3 isoform is exclusively expressed in neurons. Here we show that mice heterozygous for the alpha2 isoform display increased anxiety-related behavior, reduced locomotor activity, and impaired spatial learning in the Morris water maze. Mice heterozygous for the alpha3 isoform displayed spatial learning and memory deficits unrelated to differences in cued learning in the Morris maze, increased locomotor activity, an increased locomotor response to methamphetamine, and a 40% reduction in hippocampal NMDA receptor expression. In contrast, heterozygous alpha1 isoform mice showed increased locomotor response to methamphetamine and increased basal and stimulated corticosterone in plasma. The learning and memory deficits observed in the alpha2 and alpha3 heterozygous mice reveal the Na,K-ATPase to be an important factor in the functioning of pathways associated with spatial learning. The neurobehavioral changes seen in heterozygous mice suggest that these mouse models may be useful in future investigations of the associated human CNS disorders.\n",

      "Title: A novel CGRP-neutralizing Spiegelmer attenuates neurogenic plasma protein extravasation\n",
      "PMID:  25659966\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays an important role in the pathology of migraine, and recent clinical trials suggest the inhibition of CGRP-mediated processes as a new therapeutic option in migraine. In this study, we describe the generation of NOX-L41, a CGRP-neutralizing mirror-image (L-)aptamer (Spiegelmer) and investigate its in vitro and in vivo function. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: A CGRP-binding Spiegelmer was identified by in vitro selection. Binding studies were performed using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and the inhibitory activity was determined in cell-based assays. The pharmacokinetic profile comparing i.v. and s.c. dosing was analysed in rats. Intravital two-photon microscopy was employed to follow extravasation from meningeal vessels. Finally, in vivo efficacy was tested in a model of electrically evoked meningeal plasma protein extravasation (PPE) in rats. KEY RESULTS: We identified NOX-L41, a novel CGRP-neutralizing Spiegelmer. SPR studies showed that NOX-L41 binds to human and rat/mouse CGRP with sub-nanomolar affinities and is highly selective against related peptides such as amylin. In vitro, NOX-L41 effectively inhibited CGRP-induced cAMP formation in SK-N-MC cells. In rats, NOX-L41 had a plasma half-life of 8 h. Pharmacodynamic studies showed that NOX-L41 extravasates from blood vessels in the dura mater and inhibits neurogenic meningeal PPE for at least 18 h after single dosing. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This is the first description of the CGRP-neutralizing Spiegelmer NOX-L41. Preclinical studies confirmed a role for CGRP in neurogenic PPE and provided proof-of-concept for the potential use of this new drug candidate for the treatment or prevention of migraine.CI - © 2015 The British Pharmacological Society.\n",

      "PMID:  24370076\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Mutations in the PRRT2 gene have been identified as the major cause of benign familial infantile epilepsy (BFIE), paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) and infantile convulsions with paroxysmal choreoathetosis/dyskinesias (ICCA). Here, we analyzed the phenotypes and PRRT2 mutations in Chinese families with BFIE and ICCA. METHODS: Clinical data were collected from 22 families with BFIE and eight families with ICCA. PRRT2 mutations were screened using PCR and direct sequencing. RESULTS: Ninety-five family members were clinically affected in the 22 BFIE families. During follow-up, two probands had one seizure induced by diarrhea at the age of two years. Thirty-one family members were affected in the eight ICCA families, including 11 individuals with benign infantile epilepsy, nine with PKD, and 11 with benign infantile epilepsy followed by PKD. Two individuals in one ICCA family had PKD or ICCA co-existing with migraine. One affected member in another ICCA family had experienced a fever-induced seizure at 7 years old. PRRT2 mutations were detected in 13 of the 22 BFIE families. The mutation c.649_650insC (p.R217PfsX8) was found in nine families. The mutations c.649delC (p.R217EfsX12) and c.904_905insG (p.D302GfsX39) were identified in three families and one family, respectively. PRRT2 mutations were identified in all eight ICCA families, including c.649_650insC (p.R217PfsX8), c.649delC (p.R217EfsX12), c.514_517delTCTG (p.S172RfsX3) and c.1023A > T (X341C). c.1023A > T is a novel mutation predicted to elongate the C-terminus of the protein by 28 residues. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated that PRRT2 is the major causative gene of BFIE and ICCA in Chinese families. Site c.649 is a mutation hotspot: c.649_650insC is the most common mutation, and c.649delC is the second most common mutation in Chinese families with BFIE and ICCA. As far as we know, c.1023A > T is the first reported mutation in exon 4 of PRRT2. c.649delC was previously reported in PKD, ICCA and hemiplegic migraine families, but we further detected it in BFIE-only families. c.904_905insG was reported in an ICCA family, but we identified it in a BFIE family. c.514_517delTCTG was previously reported in a PKD family, but we identified it in an ICCA family. Migraine and febrile seizures plus could co-exist in ICCA families.\n",

      "PMID:  9406883\n",
      "Abs: The 5-HT1D receptor is a potential target of anti-migraine drugs, and here its genes were cloned from chimpanzee, gorilla and rhesus monkey, via polymerase chain reactions with their genomic DNAs and the primers designed from the 5' and 3' untranslated regions of the human receptor. Direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products revealed high degrees of identity between their deduced amino acid sequences (the chimpanzee, gorilla and rhesus monkey) and that of human, differing by two, four and 11 residues, respectively. The binding properties of the receptors, as expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, were compared to those obtained with the human and guinea pig receptors, the latter differing by 33 residues from the human receptor. Standard serotonergic ligands including several indoles, ergots and methiothepin bound all the cloned primate and guinea pig receptors with comparable, low nanomolar affinities, leading to high correlation coefficients among their Ki values. R(+)-8-Hydroxydipropylaminotetralin, on the other hand, bound the human receptor with the affinity higher than those for the primates and guinea pig receptors. This indicates that certain chemical templates may differentiate the molecular divergences among the 5-HT1D receptors of various animal species, and the use of the non-human primates will be beneficial for pharmacological characterizations, more relevant to the human receptor, of future novel ligands for the 5-HT1D receptor, which are potential anti-migraine drugs.\n",

      "PMID:  26105175\n",
      "Abs: Functional imaging studies have revealed that certain brainstem areas are activated during migraine attacks. The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is associated with activation of the trigeminovascular system and transmission of nociceptive information and plays a key role in migraine pathophysiology. Therefore, to elucidate the role of CGRP, it is critical to identify the regions within the brainstem that process CGRP signaling. In situ hybridization and immunofluorescence were performed to detect mRNA expression and define cellular localization of calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1), respectively. To define CGRP receptor binding sites, in vitro autoradiography was performed with [(3)H]MK-3207 (a CGRP receptor antagonist). CLR and RAMP1 mRNA and protein expression were detected in the pineal gland, medial mammillary nucleus, median eminence, infundibular stem, periaqueductal gray, area postrema, pontine raphe nucleus, gracile nucleus, spinal trigeminal nucleus, and spinal cord. RAMP1 mRNA expression was also detected in the posterior hypothalamic area, trochlear nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, medial lemniscus, pontine nuclei, vagus nerve, inferior olive, abducens nucleus, and motor trigeminal nucleus; protein coexpression of CLR and RAMP1 was observed in these areas via immunofluorescence. [(3)H]MK-3207 showed high binding densities concordant with mRNA and protein expression. The present study suggests that several regions in the brainstem may be involved in CGRP signaling. Interestingly, we found receptor expression and antagonist binding in some areas that are not protected by the blood-brain barrier, which suggests that drugs inhibiting CGRP signaling may not be able to penetrate the central nervous system to antagonize receptors in these brain regions.CI - © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",

      "PMID:  21797854\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Alterations in the levels of nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) have been reported in patients with primary headaches, including migraines and cluster headaches. These clinical observations suggest that N/OFQ is involved in the pathogenesis of primary headaches. OBJECTIVES: The present study was conducted to determine the role of N/OFQ in the control of trigeminal nociception and cortical excitation. METHODS: Cortical spreading depression (CSD) was elicited in Wistar rats by cortical application of potassium chloride, and electrocorticograms were recorded. N/OFQ was administered via an intracisternal injection. The presence of CSD-evoked trigeminal nociception was determined with Fos and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) immunoreactivity. RESULTS: Nociceptin/orphanin FQ produced a biphasic effect on CSD generation, characterized by an initial attenuation followed by delayed potentiation. The amplitude of CSD waves were lower in the initial period but increased in the later period. The total number of CSD waves recorded in 1 hour was greater in the N/OFQ-treated group. Exposure to N/OFQ significantly increased the number of Fos-immunoreactive cells in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis and the number of TRPV1-immunoreactive cells in the trigeminal ganglia, indicating the enhancement of trigeminal nociception. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that N/OFQ can lead to biphasic effect characterized by an initial inhibition, and delay potentiation that eventually intensify CSD-evoked trigeminal nociception.CI - © 2011 American Headache Society.\n",

      "PMID:  25079571\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Vanishing white matter disease is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy caused by mutations in any of the five genes encoding the subunits of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B. Most of the reported patients are of North American and European ancestry. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to review the clinical, radiological, and molecular characteristics of vanishing white matter disease in a cohort of French-Canadian patients. METHODS: Between 2004 and March 2012, five French-Canadian (non-Cree) patients from Quebec were clinically and genetically diagnosed with vanishing white matter disease within three Montreal Neurogenetics and Leukodystrophy clinics. Their clinical presentation and evolution, demographic characteristics, genetic mutations, and imaging were reviewed and compared with what is known in the literature. RESULTS: Sequencing of the exons and intronic boundaries of the EIF2B1-5 genes revealed a rare 260C>T (A87V) missense mutation in EIF2B3 in two homozygous patients and one compound heterozygous patient. This mutation was previously reported in only one patient in the literature. The carrier frequency is unknown. Also, three of five Quebec patients had an extremely rare vanishing white matter disease presentation of migraines with transient neurological abnormalities. CONCLUSION: The 260C>T (A87V) mutation in exon 3 of the EIF2B3 gene is likely a founder mutation for vanishing white matter disease in Quebec. Transient hemiparesthesia and hemiparesis episodes accompanied by headaches as presenting abnormalities of vanishing white matter disease are usually rare but seemed to be more frequent among the French-Canadian Quebec patients. They seemed to be preceded by periods of stress.CI - Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n",

      "PMID:  17714519\n",
      "Abs: Both calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and nitric oxide (NO) are potent vasodilators that have been shown to induce headache in migraine patients. Their antagonists are effective in the treatment of migraine attacks. In the present study, we hypothesize that vasodilation induced by the NO donor glyceryltrinitrate (GTN) or by CGRP is partially mediated via large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK(Ca)) channels. The effects of the BK(Ca) channel selective inhibitor iberiotoxin on dural and pial vasodilation induced by CGRP, GTN and endogenously released CGRP by transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) were examined. Iberiotoxin significantly attenuated GTN-induced dural and pial artery dilation in vivo and in vitro, but had no effect on vasodilation induced by CGRP and TES. Our results show that GTN- but not CGRP-induced dural and pial vasodilation involves opening of BK(Ca) channels in rat.\n",

      "PMID:  16116111\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Transporters, ion pumps, and ion channels are membrane proteins that regulate selective permeability and maintain ionic gradients across cell membranes. Mutations in CACNA1A encoding a neuronal calcium channel and ATP1A2 encoding an ion pump cause episodic ataxia, hemiplegic migraine, and seizures. Mutant gene products of both CACNA1A and ATP1A2 may affect neurotransmission of glutamate, the most abundant excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter. METHODS: We examined our patient population with episodic ataxia and hemiplegic migraine but with no mutation in either CACNA1A or ATP1A2. We looked for mutations in SLC1A3, which encodes the glutamate transporter excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT) 1 that is important in removing glutamate from the synaptic cleft. RESULTS: A patient with episodic ataxia, seizures, migraine, and alternating hemiplegia has a heterozygous mutation in SLC1A3 that is not present in his asymptomatic parents and controls. Expression studies of the mutant EAAT1 showed decreased expression of the protein with a markedly reduced capacity for glutamate uptake. When coexpressed, the mutant EAAT1 decreased the activity of wild-type EAAT1 but not of two other transporters EAAT2 or EAAT3, suggesting that mutant EAAT1 specifically multimerizes with wild-type EAAT1 to exert its dominant negative effect. CONCLUSION: Our data show that a heterozygous mutation in EAAT1 can lead to decreased glutamate uptake, which can contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability to cause seizures, hemiplegia, and episodic ataxia.\n",

PATIENT AND METHODS: A 37-year-old man since childhood developed a complex clinical picture characterized by hearing loss, migraine, ataxia, seizures, cataracts, retinitis pigmentosa, mental deterioration, and hypothyroidism. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed diffuse calcification of the basal ganglia and cerebral cortical atrophy. Morphologic and biochemical studies of respiratory chain complexes were performed in skeletal muscle. All 22 mitochondrial tRNA genes were screened for mutations by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Biochemical analysis showed normal activities of respiratory chain enzymes and citrate synthase; morphologic examination showed scattered ragged-red fibers and poor or absent cytochrome c oxidase staining in 10% of the fibers. A heteroplasmic G1606A transition in the mtDNA tRNA(Val) gene was found. Mutant DNA was 70% of the total in the proband's muscle. The mutation was absent in blood samples and urinary sediment from his healthy brother and mother.

      "Abs: Pathogenic SCN1A/Na(V) 1.1 mutations cause well-defined epilepsies, including genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) and the severe epileptic encephalopathy Dravet syndrome. In addition, they cause a severe form of migraine with aura, familial hemiplegic migraine. Moreover, SCN1A/Na(V) 1.1 variants have been inferred as risk factors in other types of epilepsy. We review here the advancements obtained studying pathologic mechanisms of SCN1A/Na(V) 1.1 mutations with experimental systems. We present results gained with in vitro expression systems, gene-targeted animal models, and the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, highlighting advantages, limits, and pitfalls for each of these systems. Overall, the results obtained in the last two decades confirm that the initial pathologic mechanism of epileptogenic SCN1A/Na(V) 1.1 mutations is loss-of-function of Na(V) 1.1 leading to hypoexcitability of at least some types of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons (including cortical and hippocampal parvalbumin-positive and somatostatin-positive ones). Conversely, more limited results point to Na(V) 1.1 gain-of-function for familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) mutations. Behind these relatively simple pathologic mechanisms, an unexpected complexity has been observed, in part generated by technical issues in experimental studies and in part related to intrinsically complex pathophysiologic responses and remodeling, which yet remain to be fully disentangled.CI - Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2019 International League Against Epilepsy.\n",

The most frequent abnormalities in ADOA plus in addition to the optic nerve affection include hypoacusis, migraine, myopathy, and neuropathy. Hypertelorism and atrophy of the acoustic nerve have not been reported. The patient is a 48yo Caucasian female with slowly progressive, visual impairment since childhood, bilateral hypoacusis since age 10y, and classical migraine since age 20y. The family history was positive for diabetes (father, mother) and visual impairment (daughter). Clinical examination revealed hypertelorism, visual impairment, hypoacusis, tinnitus, weakness for elbow flexion and finger straddling, and generally reduced tendon reflexes. MRI of the cerebrum was non-informative but hypoplasia of the acoustic nerve bilaterally was described. Visually-evoked potentials revealed markedly prolonged P100-latencies bilaterally. Acoustically-evoked potentials were distorted with poor reproducibility and prolonged latencies. Muscle biopsy revealed reduced activities of complexes I, II, and IV. Genetic work-up revealed the novel variant c.1463G>C in the OPA1 gene. This case provides novel information regarding the genotype of ADOA plus. The novel OPA1 variant c.1463G>C not only manifests with visual impairment, hypoacusis, migraine, and myopathy, but also with hypertelorisms and acoustic nerve atrophy.\n",

      "PMID:  23933184\n",
      "Abs: Although feverfew has been used for centuries to treat pain and headaches and is recommended for migraine treatment, the mechanism for its protective action remains unknown. Migraine is triggered by calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release from trigeminal neurons. Peptidergic sensory neurons express a series of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, including the ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channel. Recent findings have identified agents either inhaled from the environment or produced endogenously that are known to trigger migraine or cluster headache attacks, such as TRPA1 simulants. A major constituent of feverfew, parthenolide, may interact with TRPA1 nucleophilic sites, suggesting that feverfew's antimigraine effect derives from its ability to target TRPA1. We found that parthenolide stimulates recombinant (transfected cells) or natively expressed (rat/mouse trigeminal neurons) TRPA1, where it, however, behaves as a partial agonist. Furthermore, in rodents, after initial stimulation, parthenolide desensitizes the TRPA1 channel and renders peptidergic TRPA1-expressing nerve terminals unresponsive to any stimulus. This effect of parthenolide abrogates nociceptive responses evoked by stimulation of peripheral trigeminal endings. TRPA1 targeting and neuronal desensitization by parthenolide inhibits CGRP release from trigeminal neurons and CGRP-mediated meningeal vasodilatation, evoked by either TRPA1 agonists or other unspecific stimuli. TRPA1 partial agonism, together with desensitization and nociceptor defunctionalization, ultimately resulting in inhibition of CGRP release within the trigeminovascular system, may contribute to the antimigraine effect of parthenolide.CI - Copyright © 2013 International Association for the Study of Pain.

      "Abs: A new class of CGRP receptor antagonists was identified by replacing the central amide of a previously identified anilide lead structure with ethylene, ethane, or ethyne linkers. (E)-Alkenes as well as alkynes were found to preserve the proper bioactive conformation of the amides, necessary for efficient receptor binding. Further exploration resulted in several potent compounds against CGRP-R with low susceptibility to P-gp mediated efflux.CI - Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: To report a novel mutation in the gene EIF2B3 responsible for a late-onset form of vanishing white matter disease. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: University teaching hospital. PATIENT: A 29-year-old pregnant woman with a history of premature ovarian failure and hemiplegic migraines presented with a 10-week history of progressive confusion and headaches. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a diffuse leukoencephalopathy. RESULTS: Sequencing of the exons and intron boundaries of EIF2B3 uncovered 2 missense mutations: c.260C>T(p.Ala87Val) and c.272G>A(p.Arg91His). To our knowledge,the latter missense mutation has never been previously reported. CONCLUSION: This is the second report of adult-onset vanishing white matter disease due to mutations in EIF2B3 and the first report of the c.272G>A (p.Arg91His) missense mutation.\n",

      "PMID:  11602001\n",
      "Abs: Cerebral blood vessels are innervated by sensory nerves that store several neurotransmitters. In primary headaches, there is a clear association between head pain and the release of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Furthermore, when triptan antimigraine agents are administered, headache subsides and the neuropeptide release normalises, in part via a presynaptic effect. The central role of CGRP in primary headaches has led to the search for suitable antagonists of the receptors for this neuropeptide, which it is hoped will have less cardiovascular adverse effects than the triptans. Recently, the initial pharmacological profile of such a group of compounds has been disclosed. These compounds are small molecules with high selectivity for human CGRP receptors. Hypothetically, these agents will be efficacious in the relief of migraine headaches via blockade of the effects of CGRP.\n",

      "PMID:  17012225\n",
      "Abs: Valproate (VPA)(1) has been used for decades in the treatment of epilepsy, and is also effective as a mood stabilizer and in migraine therapy. It has been shown that VPA is also a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. We have previously shown that VPA could trigger active demethylation of ectopically methylated transiently transfected DNA in HEK 293 cells. We therefore tested whether VPA treatment could bring about stable changes in the epigenome by causing changes in the state of DNA methylation of genomic DNA. Using a microarray gene expression analysis we identified the genes whose expression is induced by VPA treatment in HEK 293 cells. We found that a subset of these genes could also be induced by the classical DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxy-cytidine (5-aza-CdR) suggesting that VPA can alter the state of expression of genes, which are stably suppressed by DNA methylation. We mapped the state of methylation of three of these genes, MELANOMA ANTIGEN B2 GENE (MAGEB2), METALLOPROTEINASE 2 (MMP2) and WIF1, which are involved in tumor growth and metastasis. A chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay revealed that VPA treatment caused as expected a change in the state of acetylation of these genes. Our data supports the concept that chromatin acetylation and DNA methylation are found in a dynamic interrelation and that the consequences of HDAC inhibitors are not limited to changes in histone acetylation but that they also bring about a change in the state of modification of DNA. The implications of our results on the future therapeutic utilities of VPA in cancer will be discussed.\n",

      "PMID:  31375062\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Migraine is a debilitating neurological disorder involving abnormal trigeminovascular activation and sensitization. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS: A rat model of conscious migraine was established through the electrical stimulation (ES) of the dural mater surrounding the superior sagittal sinus. Using patch clamp recording, immunofluorescent labelling, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and western blot analysis, we studied the effects of ES on sensory neuronal excitability and elucidated the underlying mechanisms mediated by voltage-gated ion channels. RESULTS: The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) level in the jugular vein blood and the number of CGRP-positive neurons in the trigeminal ganglia (TGs) were significantly increased in rats with ES-induced migraine. The application of ES increased actional potential firing in both small-sized IB(4)-negative (IB(4)(-)) and IB(4)(+) TG neurons. No significant changes in voltage-gated Na(+) currents were observed in the ES-treated groups. ES robustly suppressed the transient outward K(+) current (I(A)) in both types of TG neurons, while the delayed rectifier K(+) current remained unchanged. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the protein expression of Kv4.3 was significantly decreased in the ES-treated groups, while Kv1.4 remained unaffected. Interestingly, ES increased the P/Q-type and T-type Ca(2+) currents in small-sized IB(4)(-) TG neurons, while there were no significant changes in the IB(4)(+) subpopulation of neurons. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ES decreases the I(A) in small-sized TG neurons and increases P/Q- and T-type Ca(2+) currents in the IB(4)(-) subpopulation of TG neurons, which might contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability in a rat model of ES-induced migraine.\n",

      "PMID:  31565108\n",
      "Abs: Migraine is a prevalent neurological disorder which causes a huge economic burden on society. It is thought to be a neurovascular disease with oxidative stress might be involved. Curcumin, one of the major ingredients of turmeric, has potent antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, but whether it could be used as a potential treatment for migraine remains to be explored. In the present study, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were pretreated with various concentrations of curcumin (0 μM, 10 μM, 20 μM, 30 μM, 40 μM, and 50 μM) for 12 h, thereby exposed to H(2)O(2) (100 μM) for another 12 h. The viability of HUVECs was tested by the CCK-8 assay, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) were also examined. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were assayed to determine H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress. In addition, several cell death-related genes (p53, p21, Bax, and Bcl-2) were detected by PCR, and an apoptosis-related protein (caspase3) was evaluated by western blotting. Our results showed that curcumin improved the H(2)O(2)-induced decrease of cell viability and antioxidative enzyme activities and decreased the level of oxidative stress. As a conclusion, curcumin could mitigate H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress and cell death in HUVECs and may be a potential therapeutic drug for migraine.CI - Copyright © 2019 Jipeng Ouyang et al.\n",

      "Title: Evidence for CGRP re-uptake in rat dura mater encephali\n",
      "PMID:  20804493\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is widely distributed in the trigeminovascular system and released from sensory fibres of the cranial dura mater upon noxious stimulation. Such release may be a mechanism underlying migraine headache. Based on data from guinea pig basilar artery preparations, we have here studied CGRP release and uptake in an organ preparation of the hemisected rat skull. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: CGRP release from the cranial dura was quantified by a commercial enzyme-linked immunoassay. CGRP was depleted using repetitive challenges of capsaicin. After incubating the tissue with CGRP for 20 min and extensive washing, another capsaicin challenge was performed. Immunohistochemistry was used to visualize CGRP immunofluorescence in dural nerve fibres. KEY RESULTS: Capsaicin-induced CGRP release was attenuated by the transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor type I antagonist capsazepine or by Ca(2+)-free solutions. After the CGRP-depleted preparation had been exposed to exogenous CGRP, capsaicin-induced CGRP release was increased compared to the challenge just prior to incubation. CGRP uptake was not influenced by Ca(2+)-free solutions. Olcegepant and CGRP(8-37) (CGRP receptor antagonists) did not affect uptake of CGRP. However, a monoclonal CGRP-binding antibody decreased CGRP uptake significantly. Release of CGRP after incubation was attenuated by Ca(2+)-free solutions and by capsazepine. Immunohistochemical assays indicated a weak trend towards CGRP uptake in rat dura mater. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: We have presented evidence for CGRP uptake in nerves and its re-release in rat dura mater. This may have implications for the pathophysiology and treatment of migraine.CI - © 2010 The Authors. British Journal of Pharmacology © 2010 The British Pharmacological Society.\n",

      "PMID:  23473785\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is known to play a major role in the pathogenesis of pain syndromes, in particular migraine pain. Here we focus on its implication in a rat pain model of inflammation, induced by injection of complete Freund adjuvant (CFA). The nonpeptide CGRP receptor antagonist BIBN4096BS reduces migraine pain and trigeminal neuronal activity. Here we demonstrate that the compound reduces inflammatory pain and spinal neuronal activity. Behavioural experiments reveal a reversal of the CFA-induced mechanical hypersensitivity and monoiodoacetate (MIA)-induced weight-bearing deficit in rats after systemic drug administration. To further investigate the mechanism of action of the CGRP antagonist in inflammatory pain, in vivo electrophysiological studies were performed in CFA-injected rats. Recordings from wide dynamic range neurons in deep dorsal horn layers of the lumbar spinal cord confirmed a reduction of neuronal activity after systemic drug application. The same amount of reduction occurred after topical administration onto the paw, with resulting systemic plasma concentrations in the low nanomolar range. However, spinal administration of BIBN4096BS did not modify the neuronal activity in the CFA model. Peripheral blockade of CGRP receptors by BIBN4096BS significantly alleviates inflammatory pain.CI - Copyright © 2013 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B.V.

      "PMID:  29916084\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Studies involving human pharmacological migraine models have predominantly focused on the vasoactive effects of headache-inducing drugs, including sildenafil and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). However, the role of possible glutamate level changes in the brainstem and thalamus is of emerging interest in the field of migraine research bringing forth the need for a novel, validated method to study the biochemical effects in these areas. METHODS: We applied an optimized in vivo human pharmacological proton ((1)H) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) protocol (PRESS, repetition time 3000 ms, echo time 37.6-38.3 ms) at 3.0 T in combination with sildenafil and CGRP in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-dummy, three-way cross-over design. Seventeen healthy participants were scanned with the (1)H-MRS protocol at baseline and twice (at 40 min and 140 min) after drug administration to investigate the sildenafil- and CGRP-induced glutamate changes in both brainstem and thalamus. RESULTS: The glutamate levels increased transiently in the brainstem at 40-70 min after sildenafil administration compared to placebo (5.6%, P = 0.039). We found no sildenafil-induced glutamate changes in the thalamus, and no CGRP-induced glutamate changes in the brainstem or thalamus compared to placebo. Both sildenafil and CGRP induced headache in 53%-62% of participants. We found no interaction in the glutamate levels in the brainstem or thalamus between participants who developed sildenafil and/or CGRP-induced headache as compared to participants who did not. CONCLUSIONS: The transient sildenafil-induced glutamate change in the brainstem possibly reflects increased excitability of the brainstem neurons. CGRP did not induce brainstem or thalamic glutamate changes, suggesting that it rather exerts its headache-inducing effects on the peripheral trigeminal pain pathways.\n",

      "Abs: There is significant unmet need for more effective treatments for bipolar disorder. The drug discovery process is becoming prohibitively expensive. Hence, biomarker clues to assist or shortcut this process are now widely sought. Using the publicly available data from the whole genome association study conducted by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, we sought to identify groups of genetic markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in which each marker was independently associated with bipolar disorder, with a less stringent threshold than that set by the original investigators (p< or =1 x 10(-4)). We identified a group of markers occurring within the CACNA1C gene (encoding the alpha subunit of the calcium channel Cav1.2). We then ascertained that this locus had been previously associated with the disorder in both a smaller and a whole genome study, and that a number of drugs blocking this channel (including verapamil and diltiazem) had been trialled in the treatment of bipolar disorder. The dihydropyridine-based blockers such as nimodipine that bind specifically to Cav1.2 and are more penetrant to the central nervous system have shown some promising early results; however, further trials are indicated. In addition, migraine is commonly seen in affective disorder, and calcium channel antagonists are successfully used in the treatment of migraine. One such agent, flunarizine, is structurally related to other first-generation derivatives of antihistamines such as antipsychotics. This implies that flunarizine could be useful in the treatment of bipolar disorder, and, furthermore, that other currently licensed drugs should be investigated for antagonism of Cav1.2.\n",

      "PMID:  30016665\n",
      "Abs: Novel treatments against migraine are an urgent medical requirement. The α6 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors (α6GABA(A)Rs) are expressed in trigeminal ganglia (TG), the hub of the trigeminal vascular system (TGVS) that is involved in the pathogenesis of migraine. Here we reveal an unprecedented role of α6GABA(A)Rs in ameliorating TGVS activation using several pharmacological approaches in an animal model mimicking pathological changes in migraine. TGVS activation was induced by intra-cisternal (i.c.) instillation of capsaicin in Wistar rats. Centrally, i.c. capsaicin activated the trigeminal cervical complex (TCC) measured by the increased number of c-Fos-immunoreactive (c-Fos-ir) TCC neurons. Peripherally, it elevated calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactivity (CGRP-ir) in TG and depleted CGRP-ir in the dura mater. Pharmacological approaches included a recently identified α6GABA(A)R-selective positive allosteric modulator (PAM), the pyrazoloquinolinone Compound 6, two α6GABA(A)R-active PAMs (Ro15-4513 and loreclezole), an α6GABA(A)R-inactive benzodiazepine (diazepam), an α6GABA(A)R-selective antagonist (furosemide), and a clinically effective antimigraine agent (topiramate). We examined effects of these compounds on both central and peripheral TGVS responses induced by i.c. capsaicin. Compound 6 (3-10 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly attenuated the TCC neuronal activation and TG CGRP-ir elevation, and dural CGRP depletion induced by capsaicin. All these effects of Compound 6 were mimicked by topiramate, Ro15-4513 and loreclezole, but not by diazepam. The brain-impermeable furosemide antagonized the peripheral, but not central, effects of Compound 6. These results suggest that the α6GABA(A)R in TG is a novel drug target for TGVS activation and that α6GABA(A)R-selective PAMs have the potential to be developed as a novel pharmacotherapy for migraine.CI - Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

      "PMID:  32651081\n",
      "Abs: Prrt2 is a neuron-specific protein expressed at axonal and pre-synaptic domains, involved in synaptic neurotransmitter release and modulation of intrinsic excitability. Mutations in PRRT2 cause a spectrum of autosomal dominant paroxysmal neurological disorders including epilepsy, movement disorders, and hemiplegic migraine and show incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. We assessed the diagnostic rate of PRRT2 in a cohort of Italian patients with epilepsy and/or paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) and evaluated genotype-phenotype correlations. Clinical data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Twenty-seven out of 55 (49.1%) probands carried PRRT2 heterozygous pathogenic variants, including six previously known genotypes and one novel missense mutation. A family history of epilepsy starting in the first year of life and/or PKD was strongly suggestive of a PRRT2 pathogenic variant. Epilepsy patients harbouring PRRT2 pathogenic variants showed earlier seizure onset and more frequent clusters compared with PRRT2-negative individuals with epilepsy. Moreover, we did also identify individuals with PRRT2 pathogenic variants with atypical age at onset, i.e. childhood-onset epilepsy and infantile-onset PKD. However, the lack of a clear correlation between specific PRRT2 genotypes and clinical manifestations and the high incidence of asymptomatic carriers suggest the involvement of additional factors in modulating expressivity of PRRT2-related disorders. Finally, our study supports the pleiotropic and multifaceted physiological role of PRRT2 gene which is emerging from experimental neuroscience.CI - Copyright © 2020 European Paediatric Neurology Society.

      "PMID:  20078608\n",
      "Abs: WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT: * Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was first described as a potent vasodilator. * CGRP is also increasingly recognized as a key player in the pathophysiology of migraine, and CGRP receptor antagonists potentially offer a new approach for treating migraine. * A novel pharmacodynamic assay to measure CGRP receptor antagonist activity non-invasively in humans has been developed, which involves measuring the increase in dermal blood flow induced by topical application of capsaicin on the forearm. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: * This study shows that the novel oral CGRP receptor antagonist, telcagepant, inhibits the increases in dermal blood flow induced by the topical application of capsaicin on the human forearm. * This experimental medicine model may have utility to assist in dose selection for the development of CGRP receptor antagonists. AIMS: To evaluate inhibition of capsaicin-induced increase in dermal blood flow (DBF) following telcagepant (MK-0974), a potent and selective orally bioavailable calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist being developed for the acute treatment of migraine. METHODS: A three-period crossover study in 12 healthy adult men. Each subject received a single oral dose of telcagepant 300 mg, telcagepant 800 mg or placebo at 0 h, followed 0.5 and 3.5 h later by two topical doses of 300 and 1000 microg capsaicin per 20 microl water-ethanol mixture. Capsaicin was applied at two sites on the volar surface of the subjects' left and right forearms. DBF was assessed by laser Doppler perfusion imaging immediately before ('baseline'), and 0.5 h after each capsaicin application at 1 and 4 h. Plasma samples to determine telcagepant concentrations were collected immediately after laser Doppler perfusion imaging. A pharmacodynamic model was developed to explore the relationship between plasma concentration and inhibition of capsaicin-induced increase in DBF. RESULTS: Geometric mean plasma concentrations after dosing with 300 mg and 800 mg telcagepant were 720 and 1146 nm, respectively, at 1 h, vs. 582 and 2548 nm, respectively, at 4 h. The pharmacodynamic model suggested that the EC(90) for telcagepant inhibition of capsaicin-induced increases in DBF was 909 nm. CONCLUSIONS: Telcagepant inhibits the increases in DBF induced by the topical application of capsaicin on the human forearm. This experimental medicine model may have utility to assist in dose selection for the development of CGRP receptor antagonists.\n",

      "PMID:  20487037\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to determine the vascular effects of protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) activation in the rat cranial vasculature. BACKGROUND: The role of PAR-2 in pain and inflammatory conditions has been established but the information available on its effects and receptor distribution in the trigeminal vascular axis is limited. We studied the dilatory function and expression of PAR-2 in the neuro-vascular circuit, critical in migraine pathogenesis. We also investigated the interaction of PAR-2 with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and dural mast cells. METHODS: We used an improved model of intravital microscopy on the closed cranial window in rats to study the vascular effects of PAR-2 activating peptides (PAR-2 APs; SLIGRL-NH(2), 2-Furoyl-LIGRLO-NH(2)) in the dural vasculature. Measurement of immunoreactive CGRP in skull halves and in trigeminal nucleus caudalis was done by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We also analyzed the presence of PAR-2 in different migraine relevant tissues by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: PAR-2 APs and trypsin induced a dose-dependent increase in dural artery diameter. The topical application of a nonspecific nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, L-N(G)-Nitroarginine methyl ester, attenuated SLIGRL-NH(2) responses. Olcegepant, a CGRP receptor antagonist, did not a have significant effect on the SLIGRL-NH(2) responses, though exogenous CGRP responses were completely blocked. There was no significant release of CGRP from skull halves incubated with SLIGRL-NH(2) as compared with those incubated with the corresponding negative peptide. Chronic mast cell degranulation did not change the vascular effects of PAR-2 APs. mRNA and protein expression of PAR-2 were found throughout trigeminovasuclar axis. CONCLUSION: PAR-2 activation leads to vasodilation of dural arteries and these responses are partially mediated by nitric oxide. As PAR-2 is present throughout trigeminovasuclar axis, it may have a role in migraine pathogenesis, independent of CGRP and mast cell mediated mechanism.\n",

      "Abs: Depression is a polygenic and multifactorial disorder where environmental effects exert a significant impact, yet most genetic studies do not consider the effect of stressors which may be one reason for the lack of replicable results in candidate gene studies, GWAS and between human studies and animal models. Relevance of functional polymorphisms in seven candidate genes previously implicated in animal and human studies on a depression-related phenotype given various recent stress exposure levels was assessed with Bayesian relevance analysis in 1682 subjects. This Bayesian analysis indicated a gene-environment interaction whose significance was also tested with a traditional multivariate analysis using general linear models. The investigated genetic factors were only relevant in the moderate and/or high stress exposure groups. Rank order of genes was GALR2 > BDNF > P2RX7 > HTR1A > SLC6A4 > CB1 > HTR2A, with strong relevance for the first four. Robust gene-gene-environment interaction was found between BDNF and HTR1A. Gene-environment interaction effect was confirmed, namely no main effect of genes, but a significant modulatory effect on environment-induced development of depression were found. Our data support the strong causative role of the environment modified by genetic factors, similar to animal models. Gene-environment interactions point to epigenetic factors associated with risk SNPs. Galanin-2 receptor, BDNF and X-type purin-7 receptor could be drug targets for new antidepressants.\n",

      "PMID:  21394197\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: Pro-inflammatory cytokines like Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) have been implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine and inflammatory pain. The trigeminal ganglion and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) are crucial components in the pathophysiology of primary headaches. 5-HT1B/D receptor agonists, which reduce CGRP release, and cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors can abort trigeminally mediated pain. However, the cellular source of COX and the interplay between COX and CGRP within the trigeminal ganglion have not been clearly identified. METHODS AND RESULTS: 1. We used primary cultured rat trigeminal ganglia cells to assess whether IL-1β can induce the expression of COX-2 and which cells express COX-2. Stimulation with IL-1β caused a dose and time dependent induction of COX-2 but not COX-1 mRNA. Immunohistochemistry revealed expression of COX-2 protein in neuronal and glial cells. 2. Functional significance was demonstrated by prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) release 4 hours after stimulation with IL-1β, which could be aborted by a selective COX-2 (parecoxib) and a non-selective COX-inhibitor (indomethacin). 3. Induction of CGRP release, indicating functional neuronal activation, was seen 1 hour after PGE(2) and 24 hours after IL-1β stimulation. Immunohistochemistry showed trigeminal neurons as the source of CGRP. IL-1β induced CGRP release was blocked by parecoxib and indomethacin, but the 5-HT1B/D receptor agonist sumatriptan had no effect. CONCLUSION: We identified a COX-2 dependent pathway of cytokine induced CGRP release in trigeminal ganglia neurons that is not affected by 5-HT1B/D receptor activation. Activation of neuronal and glial cells in the trigeminal ganglion by IL-β leads to an elevated expression of COX-2 in these cells. Newly synthesized PGE(2) (by COX-2) in turn activates trigeminal neurons to release CGRP. These findings support a glia-neuron interaction in the trigeminal ganglion and demonstrate a sequential link between COX-2 and CGRP. The results could help to explain the mechanism of action of COX-2 inhibitors in migraine.\n",

      "PMID:  31589869\n",
      "Abs: CGRP plays a major role in the pathophysiology of migraine. Concomitant, CGRP plays a role in endogenous neurovascular protection from severe vasoconstriction associated with e.g. cerebral or cardiac ischemia. The CGRP antagonistic antibodies Fremanezumab (TEVA Pharmaceuticals) and Erenumab (Novartis/Amgen) have successfully been developed for the prevention of frequent migraine attacks. Whereas these antibodies might challenge endogenous neurovasular protection during severe cerebral or coronary vasoconstriction, potential future therapeutic CGRP agonists might induce migraine-like headaches in migraineurs. In the current study segments of cerebral artery have been used to obtain mechanistic insight of the CGRP-neutralizing anti-body Fremanezumab in neurovascular regulation in vitro. The basilar artery was selected due to its relevance in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Erenumab is known to block the human CGRP receptor and Fremanezumab to neutralize both human and rat CGRP. Results confirmed that Erenumab does not block the rat CGRP receptor and that Fremanezumab inhibits the vasodilatory effect induced by both human CGRP, rat CGRP and the metabolically stable CGRP analog, SAX in rat basilar artery. Fremanezumab also inhibits the vasodilatory effect of capsaicin in constricted segments of basilar artery. Capsaicin is used as a pharmacological tool to induce secretion of endogenous perivascular CGRP and our studies confirm that the antibody reach the perivascular sensory synaptic cleft and blocks the vasodilatory response of released CGRP in the present in vitro model. Thus, CGRP neutralization might have the mechanistic potential to block vasoprotective responses to severe vasoconstriction provided they reach the site of action and Fremanezumab is an important tool for future investigations of the impact of CGRP physiology.CI - Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

      "PMID:  16751684\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is secreted from osteoclasts and several cancer cells, as well as from sensory nerve endings innervating blood vessels and bones. A potent vasodilator, CGRP powerfully counteracts hypertensive responses and protects organs from blood pressure-related damage, though it also can precipitate migraine attacks, bronchoconstriction and hypersensitive colon. Because plasma CGRP concentrations are very low, even in patients, it is thought that CGRP functions as local modulator rather than as a circulating hormone. Nevertheless, it is useful to measure plasma CGRP when evaluating the severity of target diseases (e.g., heart failure and sepsis) and when screening or following up patients with neuroendocrine tumors (e.g., medullary thyroid carcinoma). That said, one should understand the biochemical characteristics of CGRP prior to blood sampling, and should use highly sensitive assays that detect only the active form of the molecule.\n",

      "Title: Lack of effect of the adenosine A1 receptor agonist, GR79236, on capsaicin-induced CGRP release in anaesthetized pigs\n",
      "PMID:  16232161\n",
      "Abs: Migraine is a common neurological disorder that is associated with an increase in plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) levels. CGRP, a potent vasodilator released from the activated trigeminal sensory nerves, dilates intracranial blood vessels and transmits vascular nociception. Hence, inhibition of trigeminal CGRP release may prevent neurotransmission and, thereby, ameliorate migraine headache. Therefore, the present study in anaesthetized pigs investigates the effects of a selective adenosine A(1) receptor agonist, GR79236 (3, 10 and 30 microg/kg, i.v.) on capsaicin-induced carotid haemodynamic changes and on plasma CGRP release. Intracarotid (i.c.) infusion of capsaicin (10 microg/kg/min, i.c.) increased the total carotid blood flow and conductance as well as carotid pulsations, but decreased the difference between arterial and jugular venous oxygen saturations. These responses to capsaicin were dose-dependently attenuated by GR79236. However, the increases in the plasma CGRP concentrations by capsaicin remained essentially unmodified after GR79236 treatment. The above results suggest that GR79236 may have an antimigraine potential due to its postjunctional effects (carotid vasoconstriction) rather than to prejunctional inhibition of trigeminal CGRP release.\n",

      "PMID:  30717631\n",
      "Abs: The neuropeptide of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays critical roles in chronic pain, especially in migraine. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization studies have shown that CGRP and its receptors are expressed in cortical areas including pain perception-related prefrontal anterior cingulate cortex. However, less information is available for the functional roles of CGRP in cortical regions such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Recent studies have consistently demonstrated that long-term potentiation is a key cellular mechanism for chronic pain in the ACC. In the present study, we used 64-electrode array field recording system to investigate the effect of CGRP on excitatory transmission in the ACC. We found that CGRP induced potentiation of synaptic transmission in a dose-dependently manner (1, 10, 50, and 100 nM). CGRP also recruited inactive circuit in the ACC. An application of the calcitonin receptor-like receptor antagonist CGRP(8-37) blocked CGRP-induced chemical long-term potentiation and the recruitment of inactive channels. CGRP-induced long-term potentiation was also blocked by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist AP-5. Consistently, the application of CGRP increased NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents. Finally, we found that CGRP-induced long-term potentiation required the activation of calcium-stimulated adenylyl cyclase subtype 1 (AC1) and protein kinase A. Genetic deletion of AC1 using AC1(-/-) mice, an AC1 inhibitor NB001 or a protein kinase A inhibitor KT5720, all reduced or blocked CGRP-induced potentiation. Our results provide direct evidence that CGRP may contribute to synaptic potentiation in important physiological and pathological conditions in the ACC, an AC1 inhibitor NB001 may be beneficial for the treatment of chronic headache.\n",

      "PMID:  19220306\n",
      "Abs: The parasympathetic nervous system is probably involved in migraine pathogenesis. Its activation releases a mixture of signalling molecules including vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), which subsequently stimulate VPAC(1), VPAC(2) and PAC(1) receptors. The objective of the present study was to investigate the in vivo effect of VIP, PACAP-27, PACAP-38, the selective VPAC(1) agonist ([Lys15, Arg16, Leu27]-VIP(1-7)-GRF(8-27)) and a PAC(1) agonist, maxadilan on rat middle meningeal artery (MMA) diameter using the closed cranial window model. Selective antagonists were used for further characterization of the responses. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction experiments were also conducted to determine expression of mRNA of PACAP receptors in the MMA. The results showed that VIP, PACAP-38, PACAP-27 and the VPAC(1) specific agonist evoked significant dilations with the rank order of potency; VIP = PACAP-38 > PACAP-27 = [Lys15, Arg16, Leu27]-VIP(1-7)-GRF(8-27). Significant inhibition of dilation was only observed for the VPAC(1) antagonist PG97-269 on PACAP-38-induced dilation of MMA. The VPAC(2) antagonist PG99-465 and PAC(1) antagonist PACAP(6-38) did not significantly block VIP- or PACAP-induced dilation. Expression of mRNA of all three receptors was detected in the MMA. In conclusion, the VPAC(1) receptor seems to be predominant in mediating MMA dilation. A selective VPAC(1) antagonist may be a candidate molecule in the treatment of migraine headache.\n",

      "PMID:  20354259\n",
      "Abs: Parthenolide, a sesquiterpene lactone derived from the leaves of feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium), is considered a main bioactive component of this herb. Feverfew has been used orally or as an infusion for the treatment of migraine, arthritis, fever, and stomachache. Besides its anti-inflammatory and anti-migraine properties, parthenolide also shows anticancer activities in a variety of cell lines. It contains an alpha-methylene-gamma-lactone ring and an epoxide moiety which are able to interact with nucleophilic sites of biologically important molecules. Parthenolide modulates multiple targets, thereby contributing to its various in vitro and in vivo effects. Inhibition of NF-kappaB activity, constitutive in many types of cancers, via either interaction with IKK or more directly with the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB, is considered one of the main mechanisms of its action. In addition, inhibition of STAT and MAP kinase activities and the induction of sustained JNK activity as well as p53 activity via influencing MDM2 and HDAC1 levels lead to an increased susceptibility of cancer cells to chemo- and radiotherapy. At the epigenetic level, parthenolide reduces HDAC1 level and, by inhibiting DNMT2 activity, induces global hypomethylation of DNA, which can restore the expressions of some suppressor genes. Moreover, this compound reduces the cellular level of GSH in cancer cells, followed by ROS accumulation and apoptosis. A unique property of parthenolide is its ability to induce cell death mainly in cancer cells, while sparing healthy ones and it also protects normal cells from UVB and oxidative stress. More remarkably, it seems to have the potential to target some cancer stem cells. Its wide array of biological activity and low toxicity make parthenolide a very promising drug with multi-pharmacological potential, largely dependent on the cellular context.\n",

      "Title: The nonpeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist BIBN4096BS lowers the activity of neurons with meningeal input in the rat spinal trigeminal nucleus\n",
      "PMID:  15976076\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has been suggested to play a major role in the pathogenesis of migraines and other primary headaches. CGRP may be involved in the control of neuronal activity in the spinal trigeminal nucleus (STN), which integrates nociceptive afferent inputs from trigeminal tissues, including intracranial afferents. The activity of STN neurons is thought to reflect the activity of central trigeminal nociceptive pathways causing facial pain and headaches in humans. In a rat model of meningeal nociception, single neuronal activity in the STN was recorded. All units had receptive fields located in the exposed parietal dura mater. Heat and cold stimuli were repetitively applied to the dura in a fixed pattern of ramps and steps. The nonpeptide CGRP receptor antagonist BIBN4096BS was topically applied onto the exposed dura or infused intravenously. BIBN4096BS (300 microg/kg, i.v.) reduced spontaneous activity by approximately 30%, the additional dose of 900 microg/kg intravenously by approximately 50% of the initial activity, whereas saline had no effect. The activity evoked by heat ramps was also reduced after BIBN4096BS (900 microg/kg, i.v.) by approximately 50%. Topical administration of BIBN4096BS (1 mm) did not significantly change the spontaneous neuronal activity within 15 min. We conclude that the endogenous release of CGRP significantly contributes to the maintenance of spontaneous activity in STN neurons. Blockade of CGRP receptors, possibly at central and peripheral sites, may therefore be an effective way to decrease nociceptive transmission. This may offer a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of facial pain and primary headaches.\n",

      "PMID:  1559259\n",
      "Abs: A patient is described with a 17-year history of intractable left-sided facial pain. The pain occurred daily in 5 sec spasms to a maximum of one every 2-3 min and was restricted to the left upper face. It was associated with rhinorrhoea on the left and often with ipsilateral facial flushing. Conventional therapy, including carbamazepine, baclofen and three posterior fossa explorations, had not provided lasting relief. Local facial stimulation by tapping a painful trigger point led to both pain and flushing of the face ipsilaterally. During this flushing, blood was collected and assayed using sensitive radioimmunoassays for several neuropeptides (neuropeptide Y, substance P, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and calcitonin gene-related peptide). A marked (119%) increase in calcitonin gene-related peptide was noted in the external jugular vein blood ipsilaterally during the flushing with no change in the other peptides measured. To quantitate the effect of calcitonin gene-related peptide on human extracranial vessels, standard pharmacological procedures were used to examine the potency of the peptide as a vasodilator of human facial artery. The IC50 of calcitonin gene-related peptide for the prostaglandin F2 alpha-precontracted human facial artery was 10(-9) mol/l. The relevance of these observations to the clinical problem of migraine is considered.\n",

      "Abs: Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) are vascular lesions present in some 20 million people worldwide that are responsible for seizures, migraine, hemorrhage, and other neurologic problems. Familial cases ofCCM can be inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder with variable expression. A gene for CCM (CCM/)was recently mapped to a 33-cM segment of chromosome 7q in a large Hispanic family (Dubovsky et al.1995). Here, the collection of several new short tandem repeat polymorphisms (STRPs) within the region of interest on 7q and the refinement of the marker order in this region using both linkage analysis in CEPH families and especially YAC-based STS content mapping are described. Affected members of three Hispanic families share allele haplotypes indicating a common ancestral mutation within these families. Using the shared haplotype information along with analysis of crossovers in affected individuals from both the Hispanic and Caucasian families, the region likely to contain the CCMI gene has been reduced to a 4-cM segment of 7q between D7S2410 and D7S689. All markers within the refined chromosomal segment were located on a single YAC contig estimated to be approximately 2 Mb in size. Four potential candidate genes have been mapped to this region.\n",

      "Abs: Brain calcifications may be an incidental finding on neuroimaging in normal, particularly older individuals, but can also indicate numerous hereditary and nonhereditary syndromes, and metabolic, environmental, infectious, autoimmune, mitochondrial, traumatic, or toxic disorders. Bilateral calcifications most commonly affecting the basal ganglia may often be found in idiopathic cases, and a new term, primary familial brain calcification (PFBC), has been proposed that recognizes the genetic causes of the disorder and that calcifications occurred well beyond the basal ganglia. PFBC, usually inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, is both an intrafamilial and an interfamilial heterogeneous disorder, clinically characterized by an insidious and progressive development of movement disorders, cognitive decline, and psychiatric symptoms, but also cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal signs, and sometimes isolated seizures and headaches/migraines. Heterozygous mutations in four genes (SLC20A2, PDGFRB, PDGFB, XPR1) have recently proved to be the causes of the autosomal dominant forms of PFBC, also suggesting disrupted phosphate homeostasis as \"an underlying and converging\" pathophysiological mechanism. However, to date, it is not possible to anticipate with acceptable certainty any of known genetic causes of PFBC on the basis of the type, severity, pattern of distribution, or combination of movement disorders (mainly parkinsonism, with or without tremor, but also dystonia, chorea, paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia, orofacial dyskinesia, and gait and speech disorders).\n",

      "PMID:  26805038\n",
      "Abs: Valproic acid (VPA) is a small fatty acid used for treatment of different neurologic diseases such as epilepsy, migraines or bipolar disorders. VPA modulates different processes of cell metabolism that can lead to alterations in susceptibility of several cell types to the infection of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), as well as to exert an inhibitory effect on the replication of different enveloped viruses in cultured cells. Taken these data into account and the fact that HSV-1 has been involved in some neuropathies, we have characterized the effect of VPA on this herpesvirus infection of the differentiation/maturation-inducible human oligodendrocyte cell line HOG, which resulted more susceptible to VPA inhibition of virus growth after cell differentiation. In these cells, the role of VPA in virus entry was tackled. Incubation with VPA induced a slight but reproducible inhibition in the virus particles uptake mainly observed when the drug was added in the adsorption or early upon infection. In addition, transcription and expression of viral proteins were significantly downregulated in the presence of VPA. Remarkably, when the infective viral production was assessed, VPA dramatically blocked the detection of infectious HSV-1 particles. Herein, our results indicate that VPA treatment of HOG cells significantly reduces the effect of HSV-1 infection, virus entry and productivity without affecting cellular viability.CI - Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

      "PMID:  11245850\n",
      "Abs: The cerebral circulation is innervated by calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) containing fibers originating in the trigeminal ganglion. During a migraine attack, there is a release of CGRP in conjunction with the head pain, and triptan administration abolishes both the CGRP release and the pain at the same time. In the search for a novel treatment of migraine, a non-peptide CGRP antagonist has long been sought. Here, we present data on a human cell line and human and guinea-pig isolated cranial arteries for such an antagonist, Compound 1 (4-(2-Oxo-2,3-dihydro-benzoimidazol-1-yl)-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid [1-(3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxy-benzyl)-2-oxo-2-(4-phenyl-piperazin-1-yl)-ethyl]-amide). On SK-N-MC cell membranes, radiolabelled CGRP binding was displaced by both CGRP-(8-37) and Compound 1, yielding pK(i) values of 8.9 and 7.8, respectively. Functional studies with SK-N-MC cells showed that CGRP-induced cAMP production was antagonised by both CGRP-(8-37) and Compound 1 with pA(2) values of 7.8 and 7.7, respectively. Isolated human and guinea pig cerebral arteries were studied with a sensitive myograph technique. CGRP induced a concentration-dependent relaxation in human cerebral arteries which was antagonized by both CGRP-(8-37) and Compound 1 in a competitive manner. In guinea pig basilar arteries, CGRP-(8-37) antagonised the CGRP-induced relaxation while Compound 1 had a weak blocking effect. The clinical studies of non-peptide CGRP antagonists are awaited with great interest.\n",

      "PMID:  22074408\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has a key role in migraine pathophysiology and is associated with activation of the trigeminovascular system. The trigeminal ganglion, storing CGRP and its receptor components, projects peripheral to the intracranial vasculature and central to regions in the brainstem with Aδ- and C-fibers; this constitutes an essential part of the pain pathways activated in migraine attacks. Therefore it is of importance to identify the regions within the brainstem that processes nociceptive information from the trigeminovascular system, such as the spinal trigeminal nucleus (STN) and the C1-level of the spinal cord. Immunohistochemistry was used to study the distribution and relation between CGRP and its receptor components - calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) - in human and rat STN and at the C1-level, using a set of newly well characterized antibodies. In addition, double-stainings with CGRP and myelin basic protein (MBP, myelin), synaptophysin (synaptic vesicles) or IB4 (C-fibers in general) were performed. RESULTS: In the STN, the highest density of CGRP immunoreactive fibers were found in a network around fiber bundles in the superficial laminae. CLR and RAMP1 expression were predominately found in fibers in the spinal trigeminal tract region, with some fibers spanning into the superficial laminae. Co-localization between CGRP and its receptor components was not noted. In C1, CGRP was expressed in fibers of laminae I and II. The CGRP staining was similar in rat, except for CGRP positive neurons that were found close to the central canal. In C1, the receptor components were detected in laminae I and II, however these fibers were distinct from fibers expressing CGRP as verified by confocal microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the detailed expression of CGRP and its receptor components within STN in the brainstem and in the spinal cord at C1-level, and shows the possibility of CGRP acting postjunctionally in these areas putatively involved in primary headaches.\n",

      "PMID:  12954361\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of migraine, since plasma CGRP levels increase during the headache phase. In the present study, we investigated the effects of a novel CGRP receptor antagonist, BIBN4096BS (1-piperidinecarboxamide, N-[2-[[5-amino-1-[[4-(4-pyridinyl)-1-piperazinyl]carbonyl] pentyl] amino]-1-[(3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxyphenyl) methyl]-2-oxoethyl]-4-(1,4-dihydro-2-oxo-3(2H)-quinazolinyl)-, [R-(R*,S*)]-), on the regional cardiac output distribution and on the carotid haemodynamic changes induced by alpha-CGRP in anaesthetised pigs. Treatment with BIBN4096BS (100, 300 and 1000 microg kg(-1), i.v.) did not affect the heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure or systemic vascular conductance, but a small decrease in cardiac output was noticed; the latter was, however, not significantly different from that in vehicle-treated animals. The highest dose of BIBN4096BS moderately decreased vascular conductance in the lungs, kidneys, spleen and adrenals. Vascular conductance in other tissues including the brain, heart, gastrointestinal system, skin and skeletal muscles remained unchanged. Intracarotid artery infusions of alpha-CGRP (10, 30 and 100 pmol kg(-1) min(-1) during 3 min) increased the total carotid blood flow and conductance, but decreased the arterial blood pressure. These responses were dose-dependently blocked by BIBN4096BS. The above results show that BIBN4096BS is a CGRP receptor antagonist in the porcine carotid and systemic circulations, but the endogenous CGRP does not seem to play an important physiological role in regulating basal vascular tone. These findings suggest that BIBN4096BS may have therapeutic usefulness in migraine.\n",

      "PMID:  31550910\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Acute and persistent post-traumatic headache are often debilitating consequences of traumatic brain injury. Underlying physiological mechanisms of post-traumatic headache and its persistence remain unknown, and there are currently no approved therapies for these conditions. Post-traumatic headache often presents with a migraine-like phenotype. As calcitonin-gene related peptide promotes migraine headache, we explored the efficacy and timing of intervention with an anti- calcitonin-gene related peptide monoclonal antibody in novel preclinical models of acute post-traumatic headache and persistent post-traumatic headache following a mild traumatic brain injury event in mice. METHODS: Male, C57Bl/6 J mice received a sham procedure or mild traumatic brain injury resulting from a weight drop that allowed free head rotation while under minimal anesthesia. Periorbital and hindpaw tactile stimulation were used to assess mild traumatic brain injury-induced cutaneous allodynia. Two weeks after the injury, mice were challenged with stress, a common aggravator of migraine and post-traumatic headache, by exposure to bright lights (i.e. bright light stress) and cutaneous allodynia was measured hourly for 5 hours. A murine anti- calcitonin-gene related peptide monoclonal antibody was administered after mild traumatic brain injury at different time points to allow evaluation of the consequences of either early and sustained calcitonin-gene related peptide sequestration or late administration only prior to bright light stress. RESULTS: Mice with mild traumatic brain injury, but not a sham procedure, exhibited both periorbital and hindpaw cutaneous allodynia that resolved by post-injury day 13. Following resolution of injury-induced cutaneous allodynia, exposure to bright light stress re-instated periorbital and hindpaw cutaneous allodynia in injured, but not sham mice. Repeated administration of anti-calcitonin-gene related peptide monoclonal antibody at 2 hours, 7 and 14 days post mild traumatic brain injury significantly attenuated the expression of cutaneous allodynia when evaluated over the 14-day post injury time course and also prevented bright light stress-induced cutaneous allodynia in injured mice. Administration of anti-calcitonin-gene related peptide monoclonal antibody only at 2 hours and 7 days after mild traumatic brain injury blocked injury-induced cutaneous allodynia and partially prevented bright light stress-induced cutaneous allodynia. A single administration of anti-calcitonin-gene related peptide monoclonal antibody after the resolution of the peak injury-induced cutaneous allodynia, but prior to bright light stress challenge, did not prevent bright light stress-induced cutaneous allodynia. CONCLUSIONS: We used a clinically relevant mild traumatic brain injury event in mice along with a provocative stimulus as novel models of acute post-traumatic headache and persistent post-traumatic headache. Following mild traumatic brain injury, mice demonstrated transient periorbital and hindpaw cutaneous allodynia suggestive of post-traumatic headache-related pain and establishment of central sensitization. Following resolution of injury-induced cutaneous allodynia, exposure to bright light stress re-established cutaneous allodynia, suggestive of persistent post-traumatic headache-related pain. Continuous early sequestration of calcitonin-gene related peptide prevented both acute post-traumatic headache and persistent post-traumatic headache. In contrast, delayed anti-calcitonin-gene related peptide monoclonal antibody treatment following establishment of central sensitization was ineffective in preventing persistent post-traumatic headache. These observations suggest that mechanisms involving calcitonin-gene related peptide underlie the expression of acute post-traumatic headache, and drive the development of central sensitization, increasing vulnerability to headache triggers and promoting persistent post-traumatic headache. Early and continuous calcitonin-gene related peptide blockade following mild traumatic brain injury may represent a viable treatment option for post-traumatic headache and for the prevention of post-traumatic headache persistence.

      "PMID:  28987512\n",
      "Abs: Mitochondria densely populate cells in central nervous system providing essential energy for neurons and influencing synaptic plasticity. Harm to these organelles can impair cognitive performance through damaged neurotransmission and altered Ca(2+) homeostasis. Impaired cognition could be one underlying factor which can characterize major depressive disorder, a huge burden for society marked by depressed mood and anhedonia. A growing body of evidence binds mitochondrial dysfunctions with the disease. Cognitive disturbances with different severity are also observable in several patients, suggesting that damage or inherited alterations of mitochondria may have an important role in depression. Since several different biological and environmental factors can lead to depression, mitochondrial changes may represent a significant subgroup of depressive patients although cognitive correlates can remain undiscovered without a specific focus. Hypothesis driven studies instead of GWAS can pinpoint targets relevant only in a subset of depressed population. This review highlights results mainly from candidate gene studies on nuclear DNA of mitochondrion-related proteins, including TOMM40, MTHFD1L, ATP6V1B2 and MAO genes, also implicated in Alzheimer's disease, and alterations in the mitochondrial genome to argue for endophenotypes where impaired mitochondrial function may be the leading cause for depressive symptomatology and parallel cognitive dysfunction.CI - Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

      "PMID:  23917876\n",
      "Abs: The cerebellum is classically considered to be mainly involved in motor processing, but studies have suggested several other functions, including pain processing. Calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a neuropeptide involved in migraine pathology, where there is elevated release of CGRP during migraine attacks and CGRP receptor antagonists have antimigraine efficacy. In the present study, we examined CGRP and CGRP receptor binding sites and protein expression in primate cerebellar cortex. Additionally, mRNA expression of the CGRP receptor components, calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity modifying protein 1 (RAMP1), was examined. In addition, expression of procalcitonin was studied. We observed high [(3)H]MK-3207 (CGRP receptor antagonist) binding densities in the molecular layer of rhesus cerebellar cortex; however, due to the limit of resolution of the autoradiographic image the exact cellular localization could not be determined. Similarly, [(125)I]CGRP binding was observed in the molecular layer and Purkinje cell layer of human cerebellum. CLR and RAMP1 mRNA was expressed within the Purkinje cell layer and some expression was found in the molecular layer. Immunofluorescence revealed expression of CGRP, CLR, and RAMP1 in the Purkinje cells and in cells in the molecular layer. Procalcitonin was found in the same localization. Recent research in the biology of cerebellum indicates that it may have a role in nociception. For the first time we have identified CGRP and CGRP receptor binding sites together with CGRP receptor expression through protein and mRNA localization in primate cerebellar cortex. These results point toward a functional role of CGRP in cerebellum. Further efforts are needed to evaluate this.\n",

      "Title: Role of opioid receptors in neurogenic dural vasodilation and sensitization of trigeminal neurones in anaesthetized rats\n",
      "PMID:  11454653\n",
      "Abs: Migraine headache is thought to be caused by a distension of meningeal blood vessels, the activation of trigeminal sensory neurones and the the development of a central sensitization within the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC). It has been proposed that clinically effective 5-HT(1B/1D) agonists act peripherally to inhibit the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and neurogenic dural vasodilation, and to attenuate nociceptive neurotransmission within the TNC. Since opioids are also effective anti-migraine agents the present studies investigated the role of opioids within the trigemino-vascular system in anaesthetised rats. Electrical stimulation of the dura mater evoked neurogenic dural vasodilation which was significantly inhibited by morphine (1 mg kg(-1)) the selective mu-opioid agonist DAGO (10 microg kg(-1)) and the mixed agonist/antagonist butorphanol (1 mg kg(-1)) but not by the kappa- and delta-opioid agonists (+/-) U50488H (100 microg kg(-1)) and DPDPE (1 mg kg(-1)). Morphine had no effect on CGRP-evoked dural vasodilation. In electrophysiological studies morphine (1 - 10 mg kg(-1)) significantly attenuated brainstem neuronal activity in response to electrical stimulation of the dura by 65% at 10 mg kg(-1). Morphine (3 mg kg(-1)) also inhibited the TNC neuronal sensitization following CGRP-evoked dilation. The present studies have demonstrated that opioids block the nociceptive neurotransmission within the trigeminal nucleus caudalis and in addition inhibit neurogenic dural vasodilation via an action on mu-opioid receptors located on trigeminal sensory fibres innervating dural blood vessels. These peripheral and central actions are similar to those of the 'triptan' 5-HT(1B/1D) agonists and could account for the anti-migraine actions of opioids.\n",

      "PMID:  15024829\n",
      "Abs: An abnormally expanded CAG repeats (25, normal; 4-20) was identified in the alpha 1A voltage-dependent calcium channel (CACNA1A) gene of a 50-year-old Japanese man with 25 years history of schizophrenia. At age 45, he first noted unsteadiness of standing and gait, which gradually worsened subsequently. In addition to the psychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia, neurological examination revealed marked truncal ataxia and mild limb ataxia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed atrophy of the cerebellar vermis. Gene analysis confirmed the diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA 6). No family members showed similar neuropsychiatric symptoms except that the patient's father had been suffering from an unknown dementing disease. Occurrence of both schizophrenia and SCA 6 in the identical patient may be coincidental. However, growing evidence has shown that various mutations in the CACNA1A gene are associated with phenotypic variability, such as progressive ataxia, episodic ataxia, migraine, coma, epilepsy and mental retardation. Therefore, the schizophrenic symptoms, association of which with SCA 6 has previously reported in a few cases, may represent rare clinical features of the channelopathy associated with the mutation in the CACNA1A gene.\n",

      "PMID:  22691374\n",
      "Abs: The selective 5-HT₁ receptor agonist sumatriptan is an effective therapeutic for migraine pain yet the antimigraine mechanisms of action remain controversial. Pain-responsive fibres containing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) densely innervating the cranial dura mater are widely believed to be an essential anatomical substrate for the development of migraine pain. 5-HT₁ receptors in the dura colocalize with CGRP fibres in high density and thus provide a possible peripheral site of action for sumatriptan. In the present study, we used high-resolution optical imaging selectively within individual mouse dural CGRP nociceptive fibre terminations and found that application of sumatriptan caused a rapid, reversible dose-dependent inhibition in the amplitude of single action potential evoked Ca²⁺ transients. Pre-application of the 5-HT₁ antagonist GR 127935 or the selective 5-HT(1D) antagonist BRL 15572 prevented inhibition while the selective 5-HT(1B) antagonist SB 224289 did not, suggesting this effect was mediated selectively through the 5-HT(1D) receptor subtype. Sumatriptan inhibition of the action potential evoked Ca²⁺ signaling was mediated selectively through N-type Ca²⁺ channels. Although the T-type Ca²⁺ channel accounted for a greater proportion of the Ca²⁺ signal it did not mediate any of the sumatriptan inhibition. Our findings support a peripheral site of action for sumatriptan in inhibiting the activity of dural pain fibres selectively through a single Ca²⁺ channel subtype. This finding adds to our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the clinical effectiveness of 5-HT₁ receptor agonists such as sumatriptan and may provide insight for the development of novel peripherally targeted therapeutics for mitigating the pain of migraine.CI - Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

      "PMID:  26931528\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The cryopyrin-associated periodic fever syndrome (CAPS) is an autosomal dominant autoinflammatory disorder caused by mutations in the NLRP3 gene and is typified by recurrent episodes of systemic inflammation resulting in fever, urticarial rash and arthralgia. In addition to these systemic aspects, CAPS has multiple neurological manifestations. The largest case series to date is presented focusing on the neurological features of this disorder. METHODS: The case histories of a cohort of 38 UK patients with genetically proven CAPS who were treated with interleukin 1β (IL-1β) inhibition as part of a national treatment programme and underwent detailed neurological assessment were reviewed. RESULTS: Across the entire disease course neurological manifestations were present in 95% of patients; 84% had some form of headache; 66% sensorineural hearing loss; 60% myalgia; 34% papilloedema and 26% optic atrophy. Patients with the T348M mutation tended to have a more severe neurological phenotype with an earlier age of onset. Four patients had cerebrospinal fluid examination, three of whom had evidence of aseptic meningitis. There was a marked response to IL-1β inhibition, which has revolutionized management of these patients (29/32 patients with headache responding). CONCLUSION: Neurological symptoms are extremely common in CAPS and these results highlight the importance of increasing awareness amongst neurologists, particularly as highly effective therapies are available.CI - © 2016 EAN.\n",

      "Abs: We examined the distribution and origin of the nerve fibers innervating the dura mater of the rat that show immunoreactivity for the TRPV1 receptor (TRPV1-IR). Nearly 70% of the nerve fibers showing TRPV1-IR in the dura mater also exhibited CGRP-IR. Using a combination of immunohistochemistry and a retrograde tracer technique, we detected tracer accumulation in 0.6% of the neurons in the trigeminal ganglion and a few neurons in the dorsal root ganglion; half of the neurons in the trigeminal ganglion were small- and medium-sized (<or=1000 microm2). Among the tracer-accumulated neurons in the trigeminal ganglion, approximately 25% exhibited TRPV1-IR. Furthermore, nearly 80% of the tracer-accumulated small- and medium-sized neurons in the trigeminal ganglion that exhibited TRPV1-IR also exhibited CGRP-IR. Our findings indicate that the TRPV1 receptor in the dura mater and sensory ganglia may contribute to the pathophysiology of migraine, providing an important clue for the development of therapeutic strategies for migraine.\n",

      "Abs: OBJECTIVES: The primary and secondary objectives of this phase 1 study were to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile, safety, and immunogenicity of fremanezumab subcutaneous (sc) doses tested in phase 2 and 3 trials (225 mg, 675 mg and 900 mg) following single administration in Japanese (n = 32) and Caucasian (n = 32) healthy subjects. METHODS: Japanese and matched Caucasian healthy subjects were enrolled into one of four cohorts and were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: 225, 675, or 900 mg fremanezumab, or placebo. Pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity sampling, and safety and tolerability assessments occurred at one inpatient visit and 12 ambulatory visits during the 36-week study. RESULTS: Pharmacokinetic analyses included those randomized to fremanezumab (n = 24 for each ethnic group) and safety analyses included all subjects enrolled in the study (n = 32 for each ethnic group). Fremanezumab concentration-time profiles and pharmacokinetic parameters per dose were similar for Japanese and Caucasians at all dose levels. Geometric mean ratios (GMRs) for C(max) for Japanese to Caucasian subjects were 0.91, 1.04 and 1.14 for the 225 mg, 675 mg and 900 mg fremanezumab doses. GMRs for AUC(0-inf) were 0.96, 1.09, and 0.98, respectively. Median T(max) (range 5-11 days) and mean half-lives (range 31-39 days) were similar across doses for both ethnicities. Most frequently occurring adverse events were injection site reactions, abdominal pain, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, constipation and nasopharyngitis. There was no development of anti-drug-antibodies and no clinically meaningful changes in laboratory findings. CONCLUSION: The results of the pharmacokinetic exposure parameters and safety measures were similar for Japanese and Caucasians and support the once monthly and once quarterly sc injections of fremanezumab.\n",

      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is linked to neurogenic inflammation and to migraine. Activation of the trigeminovascular system plays a prominent role during migraine attacks with the release of CGRP. The trigeminal ganglion (TG) contains three main cell types: neurons, satellite glial cells (SGC) and Schwann cells; the first two have before been studied in vitro separately. Culture of rat TG provides a method to induce inflammation and the possibility to evaluate the different cell types in the TG simultaneously. We investigated expression levels of various inflammatory cytokines on mRNA level using RT-PCR arrays and qRT-PCR; furthermore expression at protein level was studied using immunohistochemistry. We report that (1) organ culture of the TG is possible with preserved morphology, (2) organ culture is associated with enhanced expression of cytokines and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) primarily in neurons, (3) CGRP can induce expression of some cytokines and (4) cytokine expression is still upregulated following MAPK pathway inhibition by MEK inhibitor U0126 and pp38 inhibitor SB202192, but the cytokine expression is abolished when co-incubating with the JNK inhibitor SP600125. This method may be of value to examine local TG inflammation, putatively involved in the pathophysiology of some forms of primary headaches.\n",

      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Ubrogepant is a novel, oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist in development for the acute treatment of migraine. This trial evaluated the safety and tolerability of ubrogepant, focusing on hepatic safety, when administered intermittently with high-frequency dosing to healthy participants. METHODS: In this phase 1, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group trial, healthy adults (age 18-50 years) were randomized 1:1 to placebo or ubrogepant. Ubrogepant was dosed at 100 mg (2 × 50 mg tablets) on 2 consecutive days followed by 2 consecutive days of placebo, alternating for 8 weeks. Primary outcome measures were safety and tolerability. RESULTS: Of participants randomized (n = 518), 516 were included in the safety population (n = 260 placebo; n = 256 ubrogepant). Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 45% of placebo and 44% of ubrogepant participants. The most common was headache (10% placebo; 11% ubrogepant). Overall, seven cases of alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase levels ≥ 3 × the upper limit of normal (five placebo, two ubrogepant) were reported and adjudicated by a panel of independent liver experts blinded to treatment. Four cases were judged unlikely related to treatment. Two cases (one placebo, one ubrogepant) were judged possibly related, and one (ubrogepant) probably related. Alanine aminotransferase increases to ≥ 3 × the upper limit of normal in the two ubrogepant cases (possibly or probably related) were transient and resolved with continued dosing; both cases were asymptomatic, with no concurrent bilirubin elevation. CONCLUSION: Ubrogepant was well tolerated following intermittent, high-frequency dosing in healthy participants, with no clinically relevant signal of hepatotoxicity. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NA.\n",

      "PMID:  23788193\n",
      "Abs: The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) family mainly includes CGRPα, CGRPβ, adrenomedullin, calcitonin and amylin. The members of CGRP family and their receptors are widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Studies show that members of CGRP family such as CGRP and adrenomedullin play important roles in the transmission of nociceptive information. At spinal level, CGRP promotes the transmission of nociceptive information, spinal morphine tolerance, migraine, inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain. At superspinal level, CGRP suppresses the transmission of nociceptive information. Adrenomedullin is a pain-related neuropeptide which has recently been demonstrated. It facilitates the transmission of nociceptive information and is involved in the development and maintenance of opioid tolerance. The involvement of amylin and calcitonin in pain is not clear yet.\n",

      "Abs: Electrical stimulation of the Gasserian ganglion resulted in partial depletion of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from ipsilateral central terminals of pseudounipolar primary sensory ganglion cells. Affected terminals exhibit decreased CGRP immunoreactivity as shown by cytophotometric densitometry of the caudal trigeminal nucleus. The decrease in CGRP immunoreactivity is statistically significant only in the medial one-third of the caudal trigeminal nucleus. Since earlier studies have shown that electrical stimulation of the Gasserian ganglion induces first accumulation then depletion of CGRP from perivascular sensory terminals in the dura mater, the present experiments suggest that CGRP is depleted also from central terminals of primary sensory trigeminal neurons, which might be of importance in the pathogenesis of migraine headache.\n",

Calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), a peptide present in sensory trigeminal fibres, induces strong and long lasting vasodilation in cranial vessels, and has been found to be increased in jugular blood during migraine attacks. Endothelin (ET) is a recently identified potent vasoconstrictor peptide, which also induces long-lasting responses. ET-CGRP interactions may be of importance in vascular beds putatively involved in pain development in the head, and were therefore studied in isolated porcine ophthalmic arteries. Both peptides were found to induce strong and long-lasting reactions in this artery. CGRP decreased ET-induced contractions and ET decreased CGRP-induced relaxations.

      "PMID:  21737202\n",
      "Abs: Peripheral serotonin (5HT) has been implicated in migraine and temporomandibular pain disorders in humans and animal models and yet the mechanism(s) by which 5HT evokes pain remains unclear. Trigeminal pain can be triggered by activation of the transient receptor potential V1 channel (TRPV1), expressed by a subset of nociceptive trigeminal ganglia (TG) neurons and gated by capsaicin, noxious heat, and other noxious stimuli. As 5HT is released in the periphery during inflammation and evokes thermal hyperalgesia, and TRPV1 is essential for thermal hyperalgesia, we hypothesized that 5HT increases the activity of capsaicin-sensitive trigeminal neurons and that this increase can be attenuated by pharmacologically targeting peripheral 5HT receptors. TG cultures were pretreated with 5HT (10 nM-100 μM), sumatriptan (5HT(1B/1D) agonist), ketanserin (5HT(2A) antagonist), granisetron (5HT(3) antagonist), or vehicle prior to capsaicin (30-50 nM). Single-cell accumulation of intracellular calcium was recorded or calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release was measured following each treatment. In addition, using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, we detected the colocalization of 5HT(1B), 5HT(1D), 5HT(2A), and 5HT(3A), but not 5HT(2C) mRNA with TRPV1 in TG cells. 5HT pretreatment evoked a significant increase in calcium accumulation in capsaicin-sensitive trigeminal neurons and enhanced capsaicin-evoked CGRP release, but had no significant effect when given alone. Sumatriptan, ketanserin, and granisetron treatment attenuated calcium accumulation and 5HT enhancement of capsaicin-evoked CGRP release. Together these results indicate that 5HT increases the activity of capsaicin-sensitive peripheral nociceptors, which can be attenuated by pharmacologically targeting peripheral 5HT receptors, thereby providing a mechanistic basis for peripheral craniofacial pain therapy.CI - Copyright © 2011 International Association for the Study of Pain.

      "PMID:  27777505\n",
      "Abs: PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of endothelin and endothelin receptor type A genes can constitute a risk factor for normal tension glaucoma (NTG) and high tension glaucoma (HTG). METHODS: The study included 160 patients with NTG, 124 patients with HTG, and 165 healthy controls. To analyze the frequency of polymorphic variants of the endothelin EDN gene (K198N) and the endothelin receptor type A gene EDN RA (C1222T, C70G, G231A), DNA was isolated from peripheral blood, and SNP genotyping was performed using the real-time PCR (RT-PCR) method. Plasma endothelin (ET) concentrations were detected using an enzyme immunoassay. Endothelin levels were compared with genotype and allele distributions, patients' clinical status, and various risk factors for NTG. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between the patients with NTG and HTG and the controls (p = 0.035, p = 0.008) regarding the genotype of the C1222T and C70G polymorphism. Plasma concentrations of ET did not differ between the NTG and HTG groups, and no significant correlation with intraocular pressure (IOP), best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and the cup to disc ratio (c/d ratio) was seen in patients with NTG. Plasma endothelin levels showed a noticeably positive correlation with age in the NTG group (R = 0.249, p = 0.042). Higher endothelin levels corresponded to more advanced visual field damage. No statistical difference was observed between variant genotypes of K198N and the ET-1 plasma concentration in patients with NTG, whereas a slightly higher ET level was observed in the patients with HTG with the GT genotype in comparison to those with the GG genotype (p = 0.001). The C1222T polymorphism significantly affected the plasma ET level in patients with NTG. The TT genotype carriers had the highest ET level, and the CC genotype carriers the lowest (p = 0.034). The AA variant genotype of the G231A polymorphism exhibited the highest ET level, while the GG variant genotype represented the lowest level (p = 0.033). No significant differences were observed regarding the endothelin levels and the frequency of notches, peripapillary atrophy, low blood pressure, cold extremities, or migraine in the two groups studied. Slightly lower endothelin plasma levels were observed in patients with optic disc hemorrhages in the NTG group (p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphic variants of endothelin EDN (K198N) and endothelin receptor type A genes EDN RA (C1222T, C70G, G231A) affected ET plasma concentrations. There was no association between the plasma endothelin levels and the risk factors for NTG. According to these results, plasma endothelin concentrations do not appear to be a marker for NTG.\n",

      "Abs: Receptor-type ion channels are critical for detection of noxious stimuli in primary sensory neurons. Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels mediate pain sensations and promote a variety of neuronal signals that elicit secondary neural functions (such as calcitonin gene-related peptide [CGRP] secretion), which are important for physiological functions throughout the body. In this review, we focus on the involvement of TRP channels in sensing acute pain, inflammatory pain, headache, migraine, pain due to fungal infections, and osteo-inflammation. Furthermore, action potentials mediated via interactions between TRP channels and the chloride channel, anoctamin 1 (ANO1), can also generate strong pain sensations in primary sensory neurons. Thus, we also discuss mechanisms that enhance neuronal excitation and are dependent on ANO1, and consider modulation of pain sensation from the perspective of both cation and anion dynamics.\n",

      "Abs: Cramp-fasciculation syndrome (CFS) is a rare muscle hyperexcitability syndrome that presents with muscle cramps, fasciculations, and stiffness, as well as pain, fatigue, anxiety, hyperreflexia, and paresthesias. Although familial cases have been reported, a genetic etiology has not yet been identified. We performed whole-exome sequencing followed by validation and cosegregation analyses on a father-son pair with CFS. Both subjects manifested other hypersensitivity-hyperexcitability symptoms, including asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, migraine, restless legs syndrome, tremor, cold hyperalgesia, and cardiac conduction defects. Most symptoms improved with carbamazepine, consistent with an underlying cation channelopathy. We identified a variant in the transient receptor potential ankyrin A1 channel (TRPA1) gene that selectively cosegregated with CFS and the other hypersensitivity-hyperexcitability symptoms. This variant (c.2755C>T) resulted in a premature stop codon at amino acid 919 (p.Arg919*) in the outer pore of the channel. TRPA1 is a widely distributed, promiscuous plasmalemmal cation channel that is strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of the specific hypersensitivity-hyperexcitability symptoms observed in these subjects. Thus, we have identified a novel TRPA1 variant that is associated with CFS as part of a generalized hypersensitivity-hyperexcitability disorder. These findings clarify the diverse functional roles of TRPA1, and underscore the importance of this channel as a potential therapeutic target.CI - © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

      "PMID:  29244233\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: Glycogen in astrocyte processes contributes to maintenance of low extracellular glutamate and K(+) concentrations around excitatory synapses. Sleep deprivation (SD), a common migraine trigger, induces transcriptional changes in astrocytes, reducing glycogen breakdown. We hypothesize that when glycogen utilization cannot match synaptic energy demand, extracellular K(+) can rise to levels that activate neuronal pannexin-1 channels and downstream inflammatory pathway, which might be one of the mechanisms initiating migraine headaches. METHODS: We suppressed glycogen breakdown by inhibiting glycogen phosphorylation with 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-arabinitol (DAB) and by SD. RESULTS: DAB caused neuronal pannexin-1 large pore opening and activation of the downstream inflammatory pathway as shown by procaspase-1 cleavage and HMGB1 release from neurons. Six-hour SD induced pannexin-1 mRNA. DAB and SD also lowered the cortical spreading depression (CSD) induction threshold, which was reversed by glucose or lactate supplement, suggesting that glycogen-derived energy substrates are needed to prevent CSD generation. Supporting this, knocking down the neuronal lactate transporter MCT2 with an antisense oligonucleotide or inhibiting glucose transport from vessels to astrocytes with intracerebroventricularly delivered phloretin reduced the CSD threshold. In vivo recordings with a K(+) -sensitive/selective fluoroprobe, Asante Potassium Green-4, revealed that DAB treatment or SD caused a significant rise in extracellular K(+) during whisker stimulation, illustrating the critical role of glycogen in extracellular K(+) clearance. INTERPRETATION: Synaptic metabolic stress caused by insufficient glycogen-derived energy substrate supply can activate neuronal pannexin-1 channels as well as lower the CSD threshold. Therefore, conditions that limit energy supply to synapses (eg, SD) may predispose to migraine attacks, as suggested by genetic studies associating glucose or lactate transporter deficiency with migraine.

      "PMID:  19189122\n",
      "Abs: Mutations in the gene encoding the pore-forming alpha(1A) subunit of P/Q Ca(2+) channels (CACNA1A) are linked to familial hemiplegic migraine. CACNA1A Y1245C is the first missense mutation described in a subject affected with childhood periodic syndromes that evolved into hemiplegic migraine. Y1245C is also the first amino acid change described in any S1 segment of CACNA1A in a hemiplegic migraine background. We found that Y1245C induced a 9-mV left shift in the current-voltage activation curve, accelerated activation kinetics, and slowed deactivation kinetics within a wide range of voltage depolarizations. Y1245C also left-shifted the voltage-dependent steady-state inactivation with a significant increase in steepness, suggesting a direct effect on the P/Q channel voltage sensor. Moreover, Y1245C reduced Gbetagamma subunits-dependent channel inhibition probably by favoring Gbetagamma dissociation from the channel; an effect also observed using action-potential-like waveforms of different durations. The formation of a new disulfide bridge between cysteines may contribute to the Y1245C effects on activation and Gbetagamma inhibition of the channel, as they were significantly reversed by the sulphydryl-reducing agent dithiothreitol. Together, our data suggest that Y1245C alters the structure of the alpha(1A) voltage sensor producing an overall gain of channel function that may explain the observed clinical phenotypes.\n",

      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Female sex hormones are implicated in the modulation of reactivity of a wide range of blood vessels under physiological as well as pathological conditions. Migraine, a neurovascular syndrome, is 3 times more prevalent in women during their reproductive period than in men. OBJECTIVE: This study sets out to investigate the effects of the female sex steroids, 17beta-estradiol and progesterone (separately and in combination) on vasoactive responses to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), acetylcholine, and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in rat isolated mesenteric, caudal, and basilar arteries. METHODS: Female Sprague-Dawley rats were ovariectomized (Day 0) and 7 days later subcutaneously implanted with pellets releasing over a 21-day period 17beta-estradiol (0.25 mg), progesterone (50 mg), their combination, or placebo. On days 25-28, the animals were killed, arteries isolated and mounted in Mulvany myographs, and cumulative concentration response curves to CGRP, acetylcholine, and 5-HT were constructed. RESULTS: The relaxant responses to CGRP were significantly potentiated in mesenteric and caudal arteries from rats treated with 17beta-estradiol as compared to the placebo-treated rats. Acetylcholine-induced relaxations were potentiated in the caudal artery from rats treated with the combination of 17beta-estradiol and progesterone, as compared to that from placebo-treated rats. The 5-HT-induced contractions in the 3 arteries were not significantly different in efficacy or potency. CONCLUSION: Our results show that 17beta-estradiol potentiates CGRP-induced relaxations in the mesenteric and caudal arteries, while the combination treatment enhances acetylcholine-induced relaxations in the caudal artery. Although these in vitro experiments have been carried out in rats and a direct extrapolation to migraine in humans is not possible, our results may provide a new avenue to study the effects of sex steroids on vascular reactivity.\n",

      "PMID:  25449067\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: To analyze the phenotypes and proline-rich transmenbrane protein 2 (PRRT2) gene mutations in patients of infantile convulsions with paroxysmal choreoathetosis (ICCA). METHODS: Clinical data were collected from ICCA patients and their family members. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples with standard protocol. Mutations of PRRT2 were screened using PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Eleven families and one sporadic case with ICCA were recruited in this study. In 11 ICCA families, 49 family members were affected, of which 15 individuals had benign infantile convulsions (BIC) alone, 18 individuals had only paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia(PKD), and 16 individuals had BIC followed by PKD. The seizure onset age of infantile convulsions was between 3 and 12 months. The onset age of PKD was ranging from 5 to 17 years old. Four affected members in two ICCA families had PKD or ICCA co-existing with migraine. The one sporadic ICCA case had afebrile seizures between 3.5 and 4 months, and developed paroxysmal twists of limbs after 3 years and 9 months of age. He had good response to treatment with oxcarbazepine at the age of 4 years and 10 months. PRRT2 mutations were identified in all 11 ICCA families. The most common mutation, c.649_650insC (p.R217PfsX8), was detected in 6 of the 11 families (54.5%). PRRT2 mutation (c.649_650insC) was also found in the sporadic ICCA case, and was identified as de novo mutation. CONCLUSION: The phenotype of PKD in ICCA families occurred in childhood or adolescence. Few affected members in some ICCA families may have migraine. PRRT2 is the causative gene of ICCA and the mutation c.649_650insC was the hotspot of PRRT2 mutations. PRRT2 mutation was also found in sporadic case with ICCA.\n",

      "Title: CGRP receptor blockade by MK-8825 alleviates allodynia in infraorbital nerve-ligated rats\n",
      "PMID:  25370954\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Previous data showed that, in rats, anti-migraine drugs (triptans, olcegepant) significantly reduced mechanical allodynia induced by infraorbital nerve (ION) ligation but not that evoked by sciatic nerve (SN) ligation. Whether this also occurs with MK-8825, a novel anti-migraine drug also acting through CGRP receptor blockade (but chemically unrelated to olcegepant) was tested in the present study, which also investigated possible anti-neuroinflammatory effects of this drug. METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent unilateral chronic constriction injury (CCI) to either the ION or the SN, and mechanical allodynia was assessed 2 weeks later within the ipsilateral vibrissae territory or hindpaw, respectively. Transcripts of neuroinflammatory markers were quantified by real-time quantitative RT-PCR in ipsilateral trigeminal ganglion and spinal trigeminal nucleus in CCI-ION rats. RESULTS: Acute as well as repeated (for 4 days) administration of MK-8825 (30-100 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced CCI-ION-induced mechanical allodynia but was ineffective in CCI-SN rats. CCI-ION was associated with marked up-regulation of neuronal and glial inflammatory markers (ATF3, IL6, iNOS, COX2) in ipsilateral trigeminal ganglion but not spinal trigeminal nucleus. MK-8825-induced inhibition of iNOS mRNA up-regulation probably underlay its anti-allodynic effect because pharmacological blockade of iNOS by AMT (6 mg/kg, s.c.) mimicked this effect. CONCLUSIONS: These data further support the idea that CGRP receptor blockade might be a valuable approach to alleviate trigeminal, but not spinal, neuropathic pain through, at least partly, an inhibitory effect on neuropathic pain-associated increase in NO production in trigeminal ganglion.CI - © 2014 European Pain Federation - EFIC®\n",

      "Title: Effects of NMDA receptor antagonists with different subtype selectivities on retinal spreading depression\n",
      "PMID:  21699507\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spreading depression (SD) is a local, temporary disruption of cellular ionic homeostasis that propagates slowly across the cerebral cortex and other neural tissues such as the retina. Spreading depolarization associated with SD occurs in different types of stroke, and this phenomenon correlates also with the initiation of classical migraine aura. The aim of this study was to investigate how NMDA receptor antagonists with different subtype selectivity alter SD. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Immunoblotting was applied to the chick retina for NMDA receptor subunit protein analysis, and an efficient in vitro chick retinal model used with SD imaging for NMDA receptor pharmacology. KEY RESULTS: The prominent NMDA receptor subtypes GluN1, GluN2A and GluN2B were found highly expressed in the chick retina. Nanomolar concentrations of NVP-AAM077 (GluN2A-preferring receptor antagonist) markedly suppressed high K(+) -induced SD; that is, ∼30 times more effectively than MK801. At sub-micromolar concentrations, Ro 25-6981 (GluN2B-preferring receptor antagonist) produced a moderate SD inhibition, whereas CP-101,606 (also GluN2B-preferring receptor antagonist) and UBP141 (GluN2C/2D-preferring receptor antagonist) had no effect. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The expression of major NMDA receptor subtypes, GluN1, GluN2A and GluN2B in the chick retina makes them pertinent targets for pharmacological inhibition of SD. The high efficacy of NVP-AAM077 on SD inhibition suggests a critical role of GluN2A-containing receptors in SD genesis. Such high anti-SD potency suggests that NVP-AAM077, and other GluN2A-selective drug-like candidates, could be potential anti-migraine agents.CI - © 2011 The Authors.

      "Title: Intranasal noninhaled carbon dioxide for the symptomatic treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis\n",
      "PMID:  18028997\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Noninhaled intranasal carbon dioxide (CO2) has been shown to be effective in the abortive treatment of migraine headache. Migraine headache is associated with trigeminal neuronal activation and release of calcitonin gene-related peptide, events also implicated in allergic rhinitis. Intranasal CO2 might inhibit trigeminal neuronal activation and suppress the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide. OBJECTIVE: We studied whether noninhaled intranasal CO2 would be effective in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Treatment consisted of either CO2 (verum) or air (placebo) at a 2:1 ratio administered in each nostril for 60 seconds per nostril at a flow rate of 10 mL/s. The primary efficacy end point was the change from baseline in total nasal symptom score (TNSS), the sum of congestion, rhinorrhea, itching, and sneezing scored on a 0- to 5-point scale, at 30 minutes. RESULTS: Eighty-nine subjects received treatment, 60 with CO2 and 29 with placebo, and all subjects completed the study. CO2 resulted in a statistically significant improvement in TNSS at 30 minutes over placebo (absolute changes of 5.0 for CO2 and 2.2 for placebo, P = .00019). Improvement from baseline in TNSS (CO2 vs placebo) was statistically significant at 10 minutes and remained so for 24 hours. CONCLUSION: Two 60-second intranasal CO2 treatments resulted in rapid (10 minutes) and sustained (24 hours) relief of seasonal allergic rhinitis symptoms.\n",

      "Title: S+ -flurbiprofen but not 5-HT1 agonists suppress basal and stimulated CGRP and PGE2 release from isolated rat dura mater\n",
      "PMID:  12791437\n",
      "Abs: Neurogenic inflammation of the meninges, expressed in plasma extravasation and vasodilatation, putatively contributes to certain types of headache. Both, non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and serotonin-1 (5-HT1) receptor agonists are similarly effective antimigraine drugs but their mechanism of action is unclear. The clinical observation that sumatriptan lowered plasma levels of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), found increased during migraine attacks, drew attention to a possible inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release from trigeminal afferents. An isolated preparation of fluid-filled rat skull cavities was used to study effects of NSAIDs and 5-HT(1B/D) agonists on the dura stimulated by inflammatory mediators (bradykinin, histamine and serotonin, 10(-5)M each). The release of immunoreactive CGRP (iCGRP) and immunoreactive PGE(2) (iPGE(2)) was measured in 5-min samples of superfusates using enzyme immunoassays. S(+)-flurbiprofen (10(-6)M) strongly reduced the basal and stimulated iCGRP release and abolished iPGE(2) release; R(-)-flurbiprofen showed much less effect on iPGE(2) liberation and did not influence iCGRP release. The 5-HT(1B/D) agonists naratriptan and CP93,129 were ineffective on both iCGRP and iPGE(2) release. Inspite of its weak COX blocking effect, R(-)-flurbiprofen is reported to exert antinociceptive effects, although it has not been tested in migraine. Only the potent COX blocker S(+)-flurbiprofen also suppressed iCGRP release while the 5-HT(1B/D) agonists were ineffective. Thus, inhibition of meningeal neuropeptide secretion is not a common action principle of the drugs that could be essential for their antimigraine effects.\n",

      "PMID:  15735614\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays a pivotal role in migraine pathogenesis. BIBN4096BS is the first CGRP receptor antagonist available for human studies, and its efficacy in the acute treatment of migraine has been demonstrated. We investigated the ability of BIBN4096BS to inhibit human alphaCGRP (h-alphaCGRP)-induced headache and cerebral hemodynamic changes in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers completed this double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study with 2.5 mg BIBN4096BS and placebo as pretreatments before a 20-minute intravenous infusion of h-alphaCGRP (1.5 microg/min). Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography was used to measure blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCA); regional and global cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by xenon 133 inhalation single-photon emission computed tomography. The temporal and radial artery diameter was measured by high-frequency ultrasound. Systemic hemodynamics, end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PETCO(2)), and headache were monitored. RESULTS: Of the 10 volunteers, 6 had a CGRP-induced headache during the in-hospital phase after placebo pretreatment but none after BIBN4096BS (P = .031). BIBN4096BS did not affect changes in the diameter of the MCA or changes in CBF induced by h-alphaCGRP. Vasodilatation of the extracranial arteries was, however, significantly inhibited (P < .001 for temporal artery and P = .001 for radial artery). CONCLUSIONS: These results show that BIBN4096BS effectively prevents CGRP-induced headache and extracerebral vasodilatation but does not significantly affect the induced cerebral hemodynamic changes.\n",

      "Abs: The article briefly describe the innervation of the human cerebral circulation by nerve fibers containing neuropeptide Y (NPY), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), substance P (SP), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). The neuropeptides in human cerebral arteries were characterized by radioimmunoassay in combination with HPLC. These neuropeptides mediate contraction (NPY) and dilation (VIP, SP, CGRP). In conjunction with spontaneous attacks of migraine or cluster headache, release of CGRP is seen. With the associated symptoms of nasal congestion and rhinorrhea, VIP is released.

      "PMID:  11704650\n",
      "Abs: 1. Prostaglandins and the vasodilator neuropeptide, calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP), have both been implicated in the pathogenesis of migraine headache. We have used primary cultures of adult rat trigeminal neurones to examine the effects of prostanoids on CGRP release in vitro. 2. CGRP release was stimulated by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and the IP receptor agonist, carbaprostacyclin (cPGI2). These responses were extracellular calcium-dependent, and the PGE2-induced CGRP release was unaltered by inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), ATP receptor blockade, or the addition of adenosine deaminase. 3. Increases in CGRP levels were also observed in response to prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), and the EP2 receptor selective agonist, butaprost. No increases in CGRP release were observed in response to prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2alpha) or the TP receptor selective agonist, U46619, or the EP3 receptor selective agonist, GR63799X. 4. The selective DP receptor antagonist, BWA868C, antagonized the PGD2-, but not PGE2- or cPGI2-induced release. Furthermore, the EP1 selective antagonist, ZM325802, failed to antagonize the PGE2-induced CGRP release from these cells. 5. These data indicate that activation of DP, EP and IP receptors can each cause CGRP release from trigeminal neurones, and suggest that the predominant EP receptor subtype involved may be the EP2 receptor. Together with evidence that the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, aspirin, particularly when administered intravenously is effective in treating acute migraine, these findings further suggest a role for prostaglandins in migraine pathophysiology.\n",

[Cell 2017; 170: 522-533] have shown that a genetic variant associated with the 5 vascular diseases is a distal regulator of endothelin (ET)-1 gene (EDN1) expression. A common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the third intron of the PHACTR1 gene, rs9349379, is the potential variant responsible for increased risk of coronary artery disease, and lower risk of migraine, carotid dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia, and hypertension. Since ET-1 acts through ET type B receptors (ETBR) on endothelial cells to stimulate the production of nitric oxide and prostacyclin and induce vasodilation, this may contribute to these findings. Second Opinion: However, ET-1 has been demonstrated to play a role in experimental and human hypertension. How can enhanced transcription of EDN1 and translation leading to increased production of ET-1 by endothelial cells play a role in hypertension despite the availability of data that suggest a hypotensive action of ET-1? This could depend on the genetic background of individuals. In some humans, the increased ET-1 vasoconstrictor action on ETAR and ETBR in vascular smooth muscle might predominate over the vasodilator effects exerted via endothelial ETBR, thus resulting in elevated blood pressure. CONCLUSION: Alternatively, hypertension could be attributed to renal actions of ET-1. Either of these pathophysiological actions may explain a hypertensive role of ET-1 despite a lower risk of hypertension associated with the G allele at rs9349379, the common SNP in the PHACTR1 gene that is a distal regulator of EDN1 and leads to an increased expression of ET-1\n",

      "PMID:  21146804\n",
      "Abs: CHARGE syndrome is a multisystemic disorder comprising colobomas, heart defects, choanal atresia, retarded growth and development, genital hypoplasia, ear anomalies and deafness. The CHD7 gene on chromosome 8q12.1 was recently shown to be a major gene involved in the etiology of this syndrome. We describe a girl with CHARGE syndrome who had a novel mutation of CHD7 associated with agenesis of the left internal carotid artery. She had presented with recurrent episodes of photophobia and vomiting since the age of 6 years. Since her symptoms were well controlled by cyproheptadine, migraine-like attacks were considered. CHD7 molecular confirmation in this patient provides further evidence to support the occurrence of a vascular anomaly suggested from animal models of CHARGE syndrome with molecular delineation. We report this case to emphasize the importance of neurologic signs of photophobia and to highlight the broad clinical variability in this pleiotropic disorder.CI - Copyright © 2010 Taiwan Pediatric Association.

      "Abs: Mutations in the ATP1A2 gene cause familial hemiplegic migraine type 2, alternating hemiplegia of childhood, and cerebellar function deficits, epilepsy, and mental retardation. These symptoms are likely related to glutamatergic hyperexcitability. Our patient is a 12-year-old boy with a history of complex partial seizures, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and fine motor difficulty. During early childhood, he had episodes of a self-resolving right-sided hemiparesis and focal epilepsy. His seizures did not respond to several antiepileptic medications but stopped after he received valproate. His intermittent episodes of hemiplegia persisted. Additionally, he had pronounced bilateral fine motor impairment and significant executive deficits that gradually worsened. The whole exome sequencing revealed a de novo missense mutation in the ATP1A2 gene and a maternally inherited POLG gene mutation of unknown clinical significance. We hypothesized that glutamatergic excitotoxicity due to the ATP1A2 mutation contributed to the pathogenesis of our patient's condition. He was started on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists (memantine and dextromethorphan), as well as coenzyme Q(10) One year later, he showed significant improvement in sustained attention, learning efficiency, general cognitive efficiency, and fine motor dexterity. We postulate that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists were effective for behavioral, cognitive, and cerebellar symptoms in our patient with ATP1A2 gene mutation.CI - Copyright © 2018 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n",

      "Abs: A 40 year-old man with migraine presented cerebral ischemic attacks several times in one year. He had no risk factors for cerebrovascular disease including hypertension, but had strong family history suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance. A brain MRI on T(2) weighted and FLAIR images revealed patchy and confluent hyper intensity areas in the subcortical white matters and bilateral external capsules, while no anterior temporal pole lesions characteristic of CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) were detected. His skin biopsy demonstrated granular osmiophilic materials (GOM) on the basement membrane of the vascular smooth muscle cells in dermis as shown by an electron microscope. The following mutational analysis of the Notch3 gene disclosed a missense mutation of p.Arg133Cys in exon 3. Molecular diagnosis of CADASIL may be time consuming because Notch3 is a huge gene and mutations may occur at multiple sites. GOM on skin biopsy is diagnostic especially in cases where anterior temporal pole involvement on MRI is negative.\n",

      "PMID:  32583883\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway inhibitors are emerging treatments for migraine. CGRP-mediated vasodilation is, however, a critical rescue mechanism in ischemia. We, therefore, investigated whether gepants, small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, worsen cerebral ischemia. METHODS: Middle cerebral artery was occluded for 12 to 60 minutes in mice. We compared infarct risk and volumes, collateral flow, and neurological deficits after pretreatment with olcegepant (single or 10 daily doses of 0.1-1mg/kg) or rimegepant (single doses of 10-100mg/kg) versus vehicle. We also determined their potency on CGRP-induced relaxations in mouse and human vessels, in vitro. RESULTS: Olcegepant (1mg/kg, single dose) increased infarct risk after 12- to 20-minute occlusions mimicking transient ischemic attacks (14/19 vs 6/18 with vehicle, relative risk = 2.21, p < 0.022), and doubled infarct volumes (p < 0.001) and worsened neurological deficits (median score = 9 vs 5 with vehicle, p = 0.008) after 60-minute occlusion. Ten daily doses of 0.1 to 1mg/kg olcegepant yielded similar results. Rimegepant 10mg/kg increased infarct volumes by 60% after 20-minute ischemia (p = 0.03); 100mg/kg caused 75% mortality after 60-minute occlusion. In familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 mice, olcegepant 1mg/kg increased infarct size after 30-minute occlusion (1.6-fold, p = 0.017). Both gepants consistently diminished collateral flow and reduced reperfusion success. Olcegepant was 10-fold more potent than rimegepant on CGRP-induced relaxations in mouse aorta. INTERPRETATION: Gepants worsened ischemic stroke in mice via collateral dysfunction. CGRP pathway blockers might thus aggravate coincidental cerebral ischemic events. The cerebrovascular safety of these agents must therefore be better delineated, especially in patients at increased risk of ischemic events or on prophylactic CGRP inhibition.

      "PMID:  22150557\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to use protein array analysis to investigate temporal regulation of stimulated cytokine expression in trigeminal ganglia and the spinal trigeminal nucleus in response to co-treatment of sumatriptan and naproxen sodium or individual drug. BACKGROUND: Activation of neurons and glia in trigeminal ganglia and the spinal trigeminal nucleus leads to increased levels of cytokines that promote peripheral and central sensitization, which are key events in migraine pathology. While recent clinical studies have provided evidence that a combination of sumatriptan and naproxen sodium is more efficacious in treating migraine than either drug alone, it is not well understood why the combination therapy is superior to monotherapy. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were left untreated (control), injected with capsaicin, or pretreated with sumatriptan/naproxen, sumatriptan, or naproxen for 1 hour prior to capsaicin. Trigeminal ganglia and the spinal trigeminal nucleus were isolated 2 and 24 hours after capsaicin or drug treatment, and levels of 90 proteins were determined using a RayBio® Label-Based Rat Antibody Array (RayBiotech, Norcross, GA, USA). RESULTS: Capsaicin stimulated a >3-fold increase in expression of the majority of cytokines in trigeminal ganglia at 2 hours that was sustained at 24 hours. Significantly, treatment with sumatriptan/naproxen almost completely abolished the stimulatory effects of capsaicin at 2 and 24 hours. Capsaicin stimulated >3-fold expression of more proteins in the spinal trigeminal nucleus at 24 hours when compared to 2 hours. Similarly, sumatriptan/naproxen abolished capsaicin stimulation of proteins in the spinal trigeminal nucleus at 2 hours and greatly suppressed protein expression 24 hours post-capsaicin injection. Interestingly, treatment with sumatriptan alone suppressed expression of different cytokines in trigeminal ganglia and the spinal trigeminal nucleus than repressed by naproxen sodium. CONCLUSION: We found that the combination of sumatriptan/naproxen was effective in blocking capsaicin stimulation of pro-inflammatory proteins implicated in the development of peripheral and central sensitization in response to capsaicin activation of trigeminal neurons. Based on our findings that sumatriptan and naproxen regulate expression of different proteins in trigeminal ganglia and the spinal trigeminal nucleus, we propose that these drugs function on therapeutically distinct cellular targets to suppress inflammation and pain associated with migraine.CI - © 2011 American Headache Society.\n",

      "Abs: Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP) are potent vasodilators in animals and humans. PACAP infusion but not VIP infusion precipitates migraine attacks in migraine patients. The vascular effects of VIP and the two varieties of PACAP (PACAP-27 and PACAP-38) were investigated versus selective antagonists in segments of rat middle cerebral arteries (MCA), basilar arteries (BA) and middle meningeal arteries (MMA) using myographs. The luminal and abluminal effects of VIP were studied using perfusion myograph. mRNA expression of the relevant receptors (VPAC(1), VPAC(2) and PAC(1)) was examined by in situ hybridization. There was no significant difference in relaxant potency of the peptides in the MCA. In BA the relaxant potency was VIP>PACAP-27=PACAP-38. Relaxant responses were either absent or very weak in MMA. VIP was found to be somewhat more potent in BA than in the MCA. Maxadilan, a selective PAC(1)-receptor agonist, showed no relaxant effect in either vessel. The VPAC(2)-antagonist PG 99-465 alone proved ineffective in the MCA, while it had a weak effect on BA. The VPAC(1)-antagonist PG 97-269 inhibited relaxation induced by both VIP and the PACAPs in cerebral vessels. In combination, the two antagonists demonstrated better effect than either alone. VIP applied luminally via perfusion myograph caused no dilatation, indicating lack of endothelial involvement. In situ hybridization demonstrated the presence of mRNA for all three receptors in the smooth muscle cells of the vessels. In conclusion, migraine-like headache induced by PACAP-38 infusion is unlikely to be caused by direct vasodilator action on intracranial vessels.CI - Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

      "PMID:  23151434\n",
      "Abs: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a rare autosomal dominant hereditary cerebrovascular disease characterised by migraine attacks, recurrent subcortical transient ischemic attacks or strokes, cognitive decline, and dementia. It is caused by mutations in the Notch3 gene on chromosome 19p13.1, which is the only gene currently known to be closely associated with CADASIL. We describe a novel 100 base pair base fragment deletion mutation (ENST 00000263388, c.512-611del) in the Notch3 gene from a Chinese patient with CADASIL. The present patient has the characteristic clinical and family history for CADASIL, which suggests that C.512del611 may be a cause of CADASIL as well as most of the previously reported Notch3 mutations.CI - Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

      "PMID:  24506953\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: CGRP is contained in a substantial proportion of unmyelinated trigeminal neurons innervating intracranial tissues. Previously, we have described a hemisected rodent scull preparation and later the intact trigeminal ganglion to measure stimulated CGRP release from trigeminal afferents. METHODS: Here, we establish a preparation for examining CGRP release from central trigeminal terminals using single fresh slices of the mouse medullary brainstem. RESULTS: Basal and stimulated amount of CGRP substantially exceeded the detection level. Experiments were designed as matched pairs of at least six brainstem slices per animal. Stimulation with high potassium induced calcium-dependent and reversible CGRP release. Capsaicin stimulation of TRPV1 provoked concentration-dependent CGRP release. The anti-migraine drug naratriptan did not inhibit capsaicin-induced CGRP release from peripheral terminals but inhibited the release from brainstem slices. The glutamate antagonist kynurenate showed a similar pattern of site-specific inhibition of CGRP release. CONCLUSIONS: As observed earlier for other drugs used in the treatment of migraine this indicates that the central terminals in the spinal trigeminal nucleus may be the main site of action. The preparation allows evaluating the trigeminal brainstem as a pharmacological site of action.\n",

      "PMID:  15658951\n",
      "Abs: BIBN4096BS is a CGRP-antagonist effective in the treatment of migraine. Blocking the receptor of a strong vasodilator involves a theoretical risk of causing cerebral vasoconstriction, a probability not previously investigated with BIBN4096BS. Seven healthy volunteers completed this double-blinded placebo-controlled crossover study. The volunteers received randomly 10 min infusions of either placebo, 2.5 mg or 10 mg of BIBN4096BS on 3 separate days. Transcranial Doppler was used to measure the middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (V(MCA)); global and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF(MCA)) was measured by 133-Xenon inhalation SPECT. The diameter of the temporal and radial artery was measured by high-resolution ultrasound. Systemic haemodynamics and partial pressure of CO(2) (P(et)CO(2)), and adverse events were monitored regularly. BIBN4096BS had no influence on global or regional cerebral blood flow, or on the blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery. There was no effect on systemic haemodynamics and adverse events were minor. We conclude that there is no effect of CGRP-receptor blockade on the cerebral or systemic circulation in humans. Circulating CGRP is therefore not likely to exert a vasodilatory activity in the resting state and the use of BIBN4096BS for acute migraine seems to be without risk of cerebral vasoactivity. These data suggest that BIBN4096BS is the first specific antimigraine drug without vasoactive effect.\n",

      "PMID:  25679470\n",
      "Abs: Migraine is a common and disabling neurologic disorder, with important psychiatric comorbidities. Its pathophysiology involves activation of neurons in the trigeminocervical complex (TCC). Kainate receptors carrying the glutamate receptor subunit 5 (GluK1) are present in key brain areas involved in migraine pathophysiology. To study the influence of kainate receptors on trigeminovascular neurotransmission, we determined the presence of GluK1 receptors within the trigeminal ganglion and TCC with immunohistochemistry. We performed in vivo electrophysiologic recordings from TCC neurons and investigated whether local or systemic application of GluK1 receptor antagonists modulated trigeminovascular transmission. Microiontophoretic application of a selective GluK1 receptor antagonist, but not of a nonspecific ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist, markedly attenuated cell firing in a subpopulation of neurons activated in response to dural stimulation, consistent with selective inhibition of postsynaptic GluK1 receptor-evoked firing seen in all recorded neurons. In contrast, trigeminovascular activation was significantly facilitated in a different neuronal population. The clinically active kainate receptor antagonist LY466195 attenuated trigeminovascular activation in all neurons. In addition, LY466195 demonstrated an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-mediated effect. This study demonstrates a differential role of GluK1 receptors in the TCC, antagonism of which can inhibit trigeminovascular activation through postsynaptic mechanisms. Furthermore, the data suggest a novel, possibly presynaptic, modulatory role of trigeminocervical kainate receptors in vivo. Differential activation of kainate receptors suggests unique roles for this receptor in pro- and antinociceptive mechanisms in migraine pathophysiology.\n",

      "Abs: Episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2) is a dominantly inherited disorder, characterized by spells of ataxia, dysarthria, vertigo, and migraines, associated with mutations in the neuronal calcium-channel gene CACNA1A. Ataxic spells lasting minutes to hours are provoked by stress, exercise, or alcohol. Some patients exhibit nystagmus between spells and some develop progressive ataxia later in life. At least 21 distinct CACNA1A mutations have been identified in EA2. The clinical and genetic complexities of EA2 have offered few insights into the underlying pathogenic mechanisms for this disorder. We identified a novel EA2 kindred in which members had ataxic spells induced by fevers or high environmental temperature. We identified a novel CACNA1A mutation (nucleotides 1253+1 G-->A) that was present in all subjects with febrile spells or ataxia. Moreover, we found that, regardless of age or interictal clinical status, all affected subjects had objective evidence of abnormal saccades, ocular fixation, and postural stability. These findings suggest that early cerebellar dysfunction in EA2 results from the intrinsically abnormal properties of the CACNA1A channel rather than a degenerative process.\n",

      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: To characterize the nature of CACNA1A mutations in episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2), to search for mutations in sporadic cases, and to delineate better the clinical spectrum. BACKGROUND: EA2 is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by recurrent acetazolamide-responsive attacks of cerebellar ataxia. The mutated gene, CACNA1A, located on chromosome 19, encodes the alpha1A subunit of a voltage-dependent calcium channel. So far, only three CACNA1A mutations have been identified-in two EA2 families and in one sporadic case. These three mutations disrupted the reading frame and led to truncated proteins. Interestingly, distinct types of CACNA1A mutations have been identified in familial hemiplegic migraine (missense mutations) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA-6) progressive cerebellar ataxia (expanded CAG repeats). However, except for SCA-6, these genotype-phenotype correlations relied on the analysis of very few families. METHODS: To characterize CACNA1A mutations, eight familial and seven sporadic EA2 patients were selected. All 47 exons of CACNA1A were screened by a combination of single-strand conformer polymorphism and sequencing analysis. In addition, the length of the CAG repeat has been determined in all patients. RESULTS: Seven new mutations were detected in four multiple case families and three sporadic cases. Six of them lead most likely to truncated or aberrant proteins. CAG repeat sizes were in the normal range. CONCLUSION: These data clearly establish the specificity of EA2 mutations compared with SCA-6 and familial hemiplegic migraine. Detailed clinical analysis of the mutation carriers showed the highly variable penetrance and expression of this disorder: Several of the carriers did not show any clinical symptom; others displayed atypical or permanent neurologic symptoms (such as recurrent, transient diplopia or severe, permanent, and isolated cerebellar ataxia).\n",

      "PMID:  23441182\n",
      "Abs: Type 2 episodic ataxia (EA2) is the most common subtype among a group of rare hereditary syndromes characterized by recurrent attacks of ataxia. More than 60 mutations and several gene rearrangements due to large deletions in CACNA1A gene have been reported so far for the cause of EA2. Because CACNA1A gene is a large gene containing 47 exons and there is no hot spot mutation, direct sequencing will be a challenge in clinical genetic testing. In this study, we used next generation sequencing technology to identify a novel nonsense mutation of CACNA1A (p.Tyr1957Ter, NP_001120693.1) resulting in truncated protein without 305 amino acids in the c-terminus. Sanger sequencing confirmed the heterozygous mutation of CACNA1A in a Chinese family with 11 affected individuals. Affected individuals experienced recurrent attacks with or without nystagmus, dysarthria, seizure, myokymia, dystonia, weakness, blurred vision, visual field defects, diplopia, migraine, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, sweating and abdominal pain. This is the first report of EA2 in a Chinese family that carries a novel mutation in CACNA1A gene and had abdominal pain as a novel phenotype associated with EA2.\n",

      "PMID:  19860701\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a polypeptide produced by alternative processing of calcitonin gene transcripts and is endowed with important systemic physiological effects. The recent characterization of its receptor and the discovery of stable antagonists has addressed them in the indication migraine. Beside this, several studies have been focused on role of CGRP at gastric level. CGRP is considered a marker of afferent fibers in the upper gastrointestinal tract being almost completely depleted following treatment with the selective neurotoxin capsaicin that targets these fibers via transient receptor potential vanilloid of type-1. The exogenous administration of the peptide was able to afford protection against experimental ulcers induced by an increase in gastric secretion. The use of CGRP knockout mice has let to characterize the endogenous role of CGRP showing that the local release of this neuropeptide protects from ethanol injury and favours ulcer healing. Decreased levels of gastric CGRP-like immunoreactivity (li) were observed during acetic acid-, cysteamine-, concentrated ethanol- or water immersion stress-ulcers. Restoration of CGRP-li was found in animals bearing ulcers in healing status and delayed healing in mice knockout to CGRP. CGRP was able to release somatostatin from gastric D cells but its main effects on the stomach homeostasis rely on local vasodilator action during increased acid-back diffusion.\n",

      "Abs: INTRODUCTION: CADASIL is a dominant autosomal inborn systemic arteriopathy, whose genetic anomaly is located in the Notch-3 gene of chromosome 19. It is clinically characterised by migraine with aura, recurrent stroke and cognitive deterioration, and is one of the causes of strokes among the young. CASE REPORT: The propositus was a 57-year-old male who presented a clinical picture of dysarthria, loss of strength in the left extremities and alterations affecting balance with dysmetry in the left extremities, related with an acute ischaemic stroke in the cerebellar peduncle. An ultrastructural study of a biopsy specimen of the skin revealed the electron-dense deposits that characterise CADASIL. The genetic analysis identified a new mutation for this disease in codon 296 of exon 6 in the Notch-3 gene that produces a change of amino acid, from glycine to cysteine in protein (p.G296C). CONCLUSIONS: This communication reports the case of a family with CADASIL that was a carrier of a new p.G296C mutation located in exon 6 of the Notch-3 gene.\n",

      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: To quantify the abundance of dural afferent neurons expressing transient receptor potential channel melastatin 8 (TRPM8), vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGLUT3), and neurofilament 200 (NF200) in adult mice. BACKGROUND: With the increasing use of mice as a model system to study headache mechanisms, it is important to understand the composition of dural afferent neurons in mice. In a previous study, we have measured the abundance of mouse dural afferent neurons that express neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide as well as two TRP channels TRPV1 and TRPA1, respectively. Here, we conducted quantitative analysis of three other dural afferent subpopulations in adult mice. METHODS: We used the fluorescent tracer Fluoro-Gold to retrogradely label dural afferent neurons in adult mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein in discrete subpopulations of trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons. Mechanoreceptors with myelinated fibers were identified by NF200 immunoreactivity. We also conducted Ca(2+) -imaging experiments to test the overlap between TRPM8 and VGLUT3 expression in mouse primary afferent neurons (PANs). RESULTS: The abundance of TRPM8-expressing neurons in dural afferent neurons was significantly lower than that in total TG neurons. The percentages of dural afferent neurons expressing VGLUT3 and NF200 were comparable to those of total TG neurons, respectively. TRPM8 agonist menthol evoked Ca(2+) influx in less than 7% VGLUT3-expressing PANs in adult mice. CONCLUSIONS: TG neurons expressing TRPM8, VGLUT3, and NF200 all innervate adult mouse dura. TRPM8 and VGLUT3 are expressed in distinct subpopulations of PANs in adult mice. These results provide an anatomical basis to investigate headache mechanisms in mouse models.CI - © 2017 American Headache Society.\n",

      "Abs: BACKGROUND: LBR-101 is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to calcitonin gene-related peptide. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to characterize the safety and tolerability of LBR-101 when administered intravenously to healthy volunteers, by presenting the pooled results of the Phase 1 program. METHODS: LBR-101 was administered to 94 subjects, while 45 received placebo. Doses ranged from 0.2 mg to 2000 mg given once (Day 1), as a single IV infusion, or up to 300 mg given twice (Day 1 and Day 14). RESULTS: Subjects receiving placebo reported an average of 1.3 treatment-emerging adverse events vs 1.4 per subject among those receiving any dose of LBR-101, and 1.6 in those receiving 1000 mg or higher. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 21.2% of subjects receiving LBR-101, compared to 17.7% in those receiving placebo. LBR-101 was not associated with any clinically relevant patterns of change in vital signs, ECG parameters, or laboratory findings. The only serious adverse event consisted of \"thoracic aortic aneurysm\" in a participant later found to have an unreported history of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. CONCLUSION: Single IV doses of LBR-101 ranging from 0.2 mg up to 2000 mg and multiple IV doses up to 300 mg were well tolerated. Overt safety concerns have not emerged.

      "Abs: To investigate the possible role of 5HT1B and/or 5HT1D receptors in controlling neurogenic inflammation, we performed a co-localization study of the mRNA for 5HT1B and 5HT1D receptors and of substance P or calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) mRNA in the guinea pig trigeminal ganglion using double labelling in situ hybridization techniques. The 5HT1D receptor mRNA is abundant whereas 5HT1B receptor mRNA is scarce. The vast majority of cells containing substance P mRNA also contained 5HT1B receptor mRNA, but very few cells expressed substance P mRNA and 5HT1D receptor mRNA. Both receptor mRNAs were co-localized with CGRP mRNA. Hence, 5HT1D receptors may control the release of CGRP only, whereas 5HT1B receptors may control the release of both substance P and CGRP. The question remains whether selective 5HT1D agonists will have migraine abortive properties.\n",

In those patients who were noted at the time of coagulation to have flushed there were marked elevations of the local (cranial) levels of both peptides. However, in the nonflushing patients no changes in the peptide levels were observed. Parallel experiments in the cat revealed that the levels of substance P-like and CGRP-like immunoreactivity were increased during electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion. The observation of elevation of substance P-like and CGRP-like immunoreactivity after activation of the nociceptive afferent system of the head provides new insights into a putative role of peptides in the pathophysiology of migraine and cluster headache, and suggests new areas of possible therapeutic intervention.\n",

      "PMID:  22759854\n",
      "Abs: Over the last decades MRI has proved to be very useful in the field of drug development and drug discovery. Pharmacological MRI (phMRI) explores the interaction between brain physiology, neuronal activity and drugs. The BOLD signal is an indirect method to investigate brain activity by way of measuring task related hemodynamic changes. Pharmacological substances that induce hemodynamic changes can therefore potentially alter the BOLD signal and in turn falsely can be interpreted as changes in neuronal activity. It is therefore important to characterize possible effects of a pharmacological substance on the BOLD response per se before that substance can be used in an fMRI experimental setup in order to avoid false positive or false negative results. Furthermore MRI and MRA is useful in determining the vascular site-of-action of vasoactive substances. Four substances; acetazolamide, GTN, CGRP and sumatriptan has been examined in double-blind placebo controlled crossover studies. The present thesis includes three papers with the aim to determine the site-of-action and to explore the effects of the pharmacological agents on the BOLD signal. Study I showed that acetazolamide depressed the BOLD signal by increasing CBF. GTN is known to increase CBV but had surprisingly no effect on the BOLD signal. This is probably because the GTN induces CBV increase is limited to the large arteries whereas the hemodynamic changes associated with the BOLD signal are anatomically located in the capillaries and venoules. Study II and III showed that systemic administration of CGRP induces immediate headache and dilates the MMA but contrarily to previous belief does not dilate the MCA. Nor does CGRP increase brain activity per se. Sumatriptan ameliorates headache, contracts MMA and marginally contrasts MCA without altering brain activity. In conclusion we found that acetazolamide depresses the BOLD signal while GTN does not alter the BOLD signal. While systemic administration of CGRP or sumatriptan has no direct effects on brain activity in healthy volunteers. Instead it seems that both migraine provoking peptide CGRP and anti-migraine drug sumatriptan exert their actions outside of the BBB. This thesis shows that phMRI is a powerful tool in understanding mechanisms and site-of-action of pharmacological compounds. phMRI could be a useful addition to the existing methods for development of future drugs.\n",

      "PMID:  15504760\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is believed to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of migraine via activation of CGRP receptors in the trigeminovascular system. The CGRP receptor antagonist, BIBN4096BS, has proven efficacy in the acute treatment of migraine attacks and represents a new therapeutic principle. We used an improved closed cranial window model to measure changes of the middle meningeal artery (MMA) and cortical pial artery/arteriole diameter (PA) and changes in local cortical cerebral blood flow (LCBF(Flux)) in anaesthetised artificially ventilated rats. The ability of BIBN4096BS (i.v.) to prevent the vasodilatatory actions of rat-alphaCGRP, betaCGRP and endogenously released CGRP following transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) was investigated. BIBN4096BS was per se without vasoactive effect on any of the measured variables and significantly inhibited the hypotension induced by both types of CGRP (P < 0.001). The alphaCGRP induced MMA dilatation was reduced from 97.4 +/- 14 to 2.1 +/- 1.3% (P < 0.001) and the betaCGRP induced dilatation was fully blocked by BIBN4096BS. ID(50) was 5.4 +/- 1.6 microg kg(-1) for alphaCGRP and 16.3 +/- 1.6 microg kg(-1) for betaCGRP. Transcranial electrical stimulation induced a 119.1 +/- 6.9% increase in MMA diameter. BIBN4096BS (333 microg kg(-1)) attenuated this increase (19.8 +/- 2.1%) (P < 0.001). Systemic CGRP and TES induced an increase in PA diameter that was not significantly inhibited by BIBN4096BS. The CGRP induced increase in LCBF(Flux) was similar not prevented by the antagonist. We suggest that systemic BIBN4096BS exerts its inhibitory action mainly on large dural blood vessels (MMA).CI - British Journal of Pharmacology (2004).\n",

      "Abs: Large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK(Ca)) channels are membrane proteins contributing to electrical propagation through neurons. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a neuropeptide found in the trigeminovascular system (TGVS). Both BK(Ca) channels and CGRP are involved in migraine pathophysiology. Here we study the expression and localization of BK(Ca) channels and CGRP in the rat trigeminal ganglion (TG) and the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) as these structures are involved in migraine pain. Also the effect of the BK(Ca) channel blocker iberiotoxin and the BK(Ca) channel opener NS11021 on CGRP release from isolated TG and TNC was investigated. By RT-PCR, BK(Ca) channel mRNA was detected in the TG and the TNC. A significant difference in BK(Ca) channel mRNA transcript levels were found using qPCR between the TNC as compared to the TG. The BK(Ca) channel protein was more expressed in the TNC as compared to the TG shown by western blotting. Immunohistochemistry identified BK(Ca) channels in the nerve cell bodies of the TG and the TNC. The beta2- and beta4-subunit proteins were found in the TG and the TNC. They were both more expressed in the TNC as compared to TG shown by western blotting. In isolated TNC, the BK(Ca) channel blocker iberiotoxin induced a concentration-dependent release of CGRP that was attenuated by the BK(Ca) channel opener NS11021. No effect on basal CGRP release was found by NS11021 in isolated TG or TNC or by iberiotoxin in TG. In conclusion, we found both BK(Ca) channel mRNA and protein expression in the TG and the TNC. The BK(Ca) channel protein and the modulatory beta2- and beta4-subunt proteins were more expressed in the TNC than in the TG. Iberiotoxin induced an increase in CGRP release from the TNC that was attenuated by NS11021. Thus, BK(Ca) channels might have a role in trigeminovascular pain transmission.CI - Copyright 2010 IBRO.

      "PMID:  27837419\n",
      "Abs: Aim of this work was to assess the role of polymorphisms belonging to genes involved in the regulation of ionic homeostasis in Caucasian patients with Ménière Disease (MD). We recruited 155 patients with definite Ménière Disease and 186 controls (Control Group 1) without a lifetime history of vertigo, overlapping with patients for age and rate of hypertension. We validated the positive results on 413 Caucasian subjects selected from a European general population (Control Group 2). The clinical history for migraine and hypertension was collected; genomic DNA was characterized for a panel of 33 SNPs encoding proteins involved in ionic transport. We found a higher rate of migraineurs in MD subjects compared to Group 1 (46.8 vs 15.5%, p = 0.00005). Four SNPs displayed differences in MD patients compared to Group 1 controls: rs3746951 and rs2838301 in SIK1 gene, rs434082 and rs487119 in SLC8A1; the p values of Chi-squared test for genotype frequencies are 0.009, 0.023, 0.009 and 0.048, respectively. SLC8A1 gene encodes for Na(+)-Ca(++) exchanger, while SIK1 gene encodes for Salt Inducible Kinase 1, an enzyme associated with Na(+)-K(+) ATPase function. The validation with Control Group 2 displayed that only rs3746951 and rs487119 are strongly associated to MD (p = 0.001 and p = 0.0004, respectively). These data support the hypothesis that a genetically induced dysfunction of ionic transport may act as a predisposing factors to develop MD.\n",

      "PMID:  20065019\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has long been hypothesized to play a key role in migraine pathophysiology, and the advent of small-molecule antagonists has clearly demonstrated a clinical link between blocking the CGRP receptor and migraine efficacy. 2-[(8R)-8-(3,5-Difluorophenyl)-10-oxo-6,9-diazaspiro[4.5]dec-9-yl]-N-[(2R)-2'-oxo-1,1',2',3-tetrahydrospiro[indene-2,3'-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin]-5-yl]acetamide (MK-3207) represents the third CGRP receptor antagonist to display clinical efficacy in migraine trials. Here, we report the pharmacological characterization of MK-3207, a potent and orally bioavailable CGRP receptor antagonist. In vitro, MK-3207 is a potent antagonist of the human and rhesus monkey CGRP receptors (K(i) = 0.024 nM). In common with other CGRP receptor antagonists, MK-3207 displays lower affinity for CGRP receptors from other species, including canine and rodent. As a consequence of species selectivity, the in vivo potency was assessed in a rhesus monkey pharmacodynamic assay measuring capsaicin-induced changes in forearm dermal blood flow via laser Doppler imaging. MK-3207 produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of dermal vasodilation, with plasma concentrations of 0.8 and 7 nM required to block 50 and 90% of the blood flow increase, respectively. The tritiated analog [3H]MK-3207 was used to study the binding characteristics on the human CGRP receptor. [3H]MK-3207 displayed reversible and saturable binding (K(D) = 0.06 nM), and the off-rate was determined to be 0.012 min(-1), with a t(1/2) value of 59 min. In vitro autoradiography studies on rhesus monkey brain slices identified the highest level of binding in the cerebellum, brainstem, and meninges. Finally, as an index of central nervous system penetrability, the in vivo cerebrospinal fluid/plasma ratio was determined to be 2 to 3% in cisterna magna-ported rhesus monkeys.\n",

      "PMID:  26083947\n",
      "Abs: The detrimental effects of T-cell-secreted interferon gamma (IFNγ) on oxidative stress (OS) and demyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS) are well recognized. Recently, we demonstrated that IFNγ-mediated damage to myelin also increases susceptibility to spreading depression (SD; the likely basis of migraine with aura). However, before onset of MS, induction of physiological levels of IFNγ, like that produced by environmental enrichment (EE), protects against demyelination and OS. Accordingly, we focused on the potential for physiological levels of IFNγ to protect against SD. EE, which occurs with a moderate and phasic increase in proinflammatory cytokines, reduces migraine frequency. Thus, we applied phasic or pulsed IFNγ to brain slice cultures to emulate EE. This treatment reduced OS, increased myelin basic protein, a marker for myelin, and reduced susceptibility to SD. Building on our research on exosomes in EE-based neuroprotection, we found that IFNγ stimulation of slice cultures induced release of exosomes, likely from the microglia that produce the same protective effects as IFNγ treatment when applied to naive cultures. Finally, nasal administration of IFNγ to rats recapitulated in vitro effects, reducing OS, increasing myelin, and reducing SD. These results support phasic IFNγ signaling as a therapeutic target for prevention of SD and, by extension, migraine.\n",

      "Abs: Etiologic diagnosis of adulthood leukodystrophy is challenging in neurologic practice. We describe here the clinico-radiological features of a novel autosomal dominant leukodystrophy in a single family. Clinical and MRI features were recorded in a three generation family. Exome sequencing was performed in two affected relatives and one healthy member. Four total relatives (3 women and 1 man, mean age at onset: 45, range 32-59) were followed: 2 for migraine and 2 for cognitive loss. MRI features were homogeneous in the four affected relatives: extensive and symmetrical white matter hyperintensities on T2-weighted images, with a posterior predominance, involvement of the middle cerebellar peduncles, corpus callosum and the posterior limb of the internal capsules. An extensive metabolic screening was negative. In addition, sequencing of pathogenic genes involved in dominant leukodystrophies (NOTCH3, LMNB1, GFAP, CSF1R) was negative. No mutation has been identified yet with exome sequencing. This report is peculiar because of dominant inheritance, adult onset, highly homogeneous white matter hyperintensities on T2-weighted MR images, predominant in the middle cerebellar peduncles and posterior part of internal capsule and absence of mutation of the genes involved in dominant leukodystrophies.\n",

      "Abs: CGRP is an important neuropeptide found throughout the cardiovascular system. However, until recently it has been difficult to define its pharmacology or physiological role because of the lack of suitable antagonists. BIBN4096BS is a high-affinity, nonpeptide antagonist that shows much greater selectivity for human CGRP1 receptors compared to any other drug. Its pharmacology has been defined with studies on transfected cells or cell lines endogenously expressing receptors of known composition. These have allowed confirmation that in many human blood vessels, CGRP is working via CGRP1 receptors. However, it also interacts with other CGRP-activated receptors, of unknown composition. In vivo, clinical studies have shown that BIBN4096BS is likely to be useful in the treatment of migraine. It has also been used to define the role of CGRP in phenomena such as plasma extravasation and cardioprotection following ischemia.\n",

      "Abs: The A 3243 G mutation of the mitochondrial tRNA(Leu) gene was found to segregate with maternally inherited diabetes mellitus, sensorineural deafness, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or renal failure in a large pedigree of 35 affected members in four generations. Presenting symptoms almost consistently involved deafness and recurrent attacks of migraine-like headaches, but the clinical course of the disease varied within and across generations. The A 3243 G mutation has been previously reported in association with the mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episode syndrome (MELAS) and with diabetes mellitus and deafness. To our knowledge, however, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is not a common feature in people with the A 3243 G mutation and renal failure has not been hitherto reported in association with this mutation.

      "PMID:  1865750\n",
      "Abs: Low pH medium has been shown to activate the 'efferent' function of capsaicin-sensitive primary sensory neurons. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is released from capsaicin-sensitive afferents of guinea-pig superior sagittal and transverse sinuses (SSTS), by capsaicin or bradykinin. Here, we report that low pH medium produces a remarkable release of CGRP from SSTS, which was dependent on the concentration of hydrogen ions of the medium (pH 7-5). Moreover, the pH 5-evoked release of CGRP-LI was markedly reduced (by about 70%) in a calcium-free medium containing 1 mM EDTA or abolished in samples pre-exposed to 10 microM capsaicin. The present observation that lowering of the pH promotes release of a powerful vasoactive peptide from perivascular capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves may have some relevance in the pathophysiology of brain injury and migraine headaches.\n",

      "PMID:  25463029\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists have demonstrated anti-migraine efficacy. One remaining question is where do these blockers act? We hypothesized that the trigeminal ganglion could be one possible site. We examined the binding sites of a CGRP receptor antagonist (MK-3207) and related this to the expression of CGRP and its receptor in rhesus trigeminal ganglion. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and glutamate were examined and related to the CGRP system. Furthermore, we examined if the trigeminal ganglion is protected by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Autoradiography was performed with [(3)H]MK-3207 to demonstrate receptor binding sites in rhesus trigeminal ganglion (TG). Immunofluorescence was used to correlate binding and the presence of CGRP and its receptor components, calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1), and the distribution of PACAP and glutamate in rhesus and rat TG. Evans blue was used to examine large molecule penetration into the rat TG. High receptor binding densities were found in rhesus TG. Immunofluorescence revealed expression of CGRP, CLR and RAMP1 in trigeminal cells. CGRP positive neurons expressed PACAP but not glutamate. Some neurons expressing CLR and RAMP1 co-localized with glutamate. Evans blue revealed that the TG is not protected by BBB. This study demonstrates CGRP receptor binding sites and expression of the CGRP receptor in rhesus and rat TG. The expression pattern of PACAP and glutamate suggests a possible interaction between the glutamatergic and CGRP system. In rat the TG is outside the BBB, suggesting that molecules do not need to be CNS-penetrant to block these receptors.CI - Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "PMID:  21739915\n",
      "Abs: INTRODUCTION: Fast and precise diagnostics of the disease from the large group of adult leukoencephalopathy is difficult but responsible job, because the outcome of the disease is very often determined by its name. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is caused by the mutation of Notch 3 gene on chromosome locus 19p13. Beside the brain arterioles being the main disease targets, extracerebral small blood vessels are affected by the pathological process. Clinically present signs are recurrent ischemic strokes and vascular dementia. CADASIL in its progressive form shows a distinctive pattern of pathological changes on MRI of endocranium. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of granular osmiophilic material (GOM) in histopathological skin biopsies. CASE REPORTS: Two young adult patients manifested ischemic strokes of unknown etiology, cognitive deterioration, migraine and psychopathological phenomenology. MRI of endocranium pointed on CADASIL. Ultrastructural examination of skin biopsy proved the presence of GOM in the basal lamina and near smooth muscle cells of arteriole dermis leading to CADASIL diagnosis. The presence of GOM in histopathological preparation is 100% specific for CADASIL. The patients were not searched for mutation in Notch 3 gene on chromosome 19, because some other leukoencephalopathy was disregarded. CONCLUSION: Suggestive clinical picture, distinctive finding of endocranium MRI, the presence of GOM by ultrastructural examination of histopathological skin biopsies are sufficient to confirm CADASIL diagnosis.\n",

      "Abs: We report a 52-year-old man with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) presenting dementia, alopecia and lumbar herniated disk. He had an episode of stroke and migraine-like headache lasting for 5 minutes. A lot of members had cerebral infarction in this family. Brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated, on T2-weighted images, numerous hyperintense lesions suggestive of small infarcts in the basal ganglia and diffuse hyperintense lesions in the cerebral white matter. The clinical symptoms, the family history and the MRI findings suggested the diagnosis of CADASIL. However, the patient also showed alopecia and lumbar herniated disk, both are characteristic features of cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL). The DNA analysis of the Notch 3 gene identified a novel missense mutation Cys174Phe in this patient. Our case report indicated the importance of the DNA analysis for the diagnosis of CADASIL.\n",

      "PMID:  9225276\n",
      "Abs: Human 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors have been implicated as molecular targets for the treatment of acute migraine based upon the pharmacological actions and clinical efficacy of sumatriptan, an agonist for human 5-HT1B/1D receptors. The guinea pig has served as an animal model to assess 5-HT1B/1D receptor function, most recently in evaluating 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists as potential anti-migraine agents. Since two distinct, but closely-related receptors displaying \"5-HT1D receptor pharmacology\" have been cloned previously from most mammalian species, the genes encoding these receptors were isolated from a guinea pig liver genomic DNA library using oligonucleotide probes targeted to nonconserved regions of recombinant human 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors. Sequence analysis indicates that guinea pig 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors are comprised 390 and 378 amino acids, respectively. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of guinea pig 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor subtypes show that they display overall and transmembrane (TM) identities of 63% and 77%, respectively. Both clones contain a conserved threonine residue in TM7, a structural feature imparting \"5-HT1D receptor pharmacology\". Guinea pig 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor genes were transiently expressed in Cos-7 cells and their binding properties were evaluated using [3H]5-HT. Both cloned receptor subtypes displayed \"5-HT1D receptor pharmacology\" with the following rank order of binding affinities: 5-CT > 5-HT > sumatriptan > 8-OH-DPAT > (-)-pindolol. Ketanserin displayed modest (five-fold) 5-HT1D receptor selectivity, while methiothepin exhibited a similar selectivity for the 5-HT1B subtype. In particular, ketanserin exhibits profound differences in 5-HT1D receptor affinity (and selectivity) across species. High correlations were observed between the binding affinities of serotonergic ligands for 5-HT1D binding sites measured in guinea pig cortical membranes and both cloned guinea pig 5-HT1B (r2 = 0.88) and 5-HT1D (r2 = 0.80) receptors, indicating that the development of subtype selective compounds (i.e. 5-HT1B versus 5-HT1D) using native tissues may be more difficult to achieve without the advantage of using recombinant receptor subtypes. Additionally, there is a good correspondence between binding profiles of recombinant guinea pig 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor subtypes and to their respective cloned human homologs. However, species differences in binding affinities of a subset of compounds are evident. These data extend previous observations that subtype selective (i.e. 5-HT1D) compounds identified in one species may not discriminate between closely related receptors (i.e. 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D) in all animal model systems.\n",

      "PMID:  19425099\n",
      "Abs: Migraine sufferers frequently testify that their headache feels as if the calvarial bones are deformed, crushed, or broken (Jakubowski et al. [2006] Pain 125:286-295). This has lead us to postulate that the calvarial bones are supplied by sensory fibers. We studied sensory innervation of the calvaria in coronal and horizontal sections of whole-head preparations of postnatal and adult mice, via immunostaining of peripherin (a marker of thinly myelinated and unmyelinated fibers) or calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP; a marker more typical of unmyelinated nerve fibers). In pups, we observed nerve bundles coursing between the galea aponeurotica and the periosteum, between the periosteum and the bone, and between the bone and the meninges; as well as fibers that run inside the diploë in different orientations. Some dural fibers issued collateral branches to the pia at the frontal part of the brain. In the adult calvaria, the highest concentration of peripherin- and CGRP-labeled fibers was found in sutures, where they appeared to emerge from the dura. Labeled fibers were also observed in emissary canals, bone marrow, and periosteum. In contrast to the case in pups, no labeled fibers were found in the diploë of the adult calvaria. Meningeal nerves that infiltrate the periosteum through the calvarial sutures may be positioned to mediate migraine headache triggered by pathophysiology of extracranial tissues, such as muscle tenderness and mild trauma to the skull. In view of the concentration of sensory fibers in the sutures, it may be useful to avoid drilling the sutures in patients undergoing craniotomies for a variety of neurosurgical procedures.CI - Copyright 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.\n",

      "PMID:  25287861\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a 37-amino acid neuropeptide. Discovered 30 years ago, it is produced as a consequence of alternative RNA processing of the calcitonin gene. CGRP has two major forms (α and β). It belongs to a group of peptides that all act on an unusual receptor family. These receptors consist of calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) linked to an essential receptor activity modifying protein (RAMP) that is necessary for full functionality. CGRP is a highly potent vasodilator and, partly as a consequence, possesses protective mechanisms that are important for physiological and pathological conditions involving the cardiovascular system and wound healing. CGRP is primarily released from sensory nerves and thus is implicated in pain pathways. The proven ability of CGRP antagonists to alleviate migraine has been of most interest in terms of drug development, and knowledge to date concerning this potential therapeutic area is discussed. Other areas covered, where there is less information known on CGRP, include arthritis, skin conditions, diabetes, and obesity. It is concluded that CGRP is an important peptide in mammalian biology, but it is too early at present to know if new medicines for disease treatment will emerge from our knowledge concerning this molecule.CI - Copyright © 2014 the American Physiological Society.\n",

      "Abs: Peptides released from trigeminal fibers fulfill well-understood functions in neuroinflammatory processes and in the modulation of nociceptive signal processing. In particular, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP), released from afferent nerve terminals, exert paracrine effects on the surrounding tissue and this has been recently highlighted by the prominent parcrine role of CGRP in the development of headache and migraine. Some recent communications suggest that these sensory neuropeptides may also modulate the workings of sensory organs and influence afferent signals from nose, tongue, eyes and ears. Here, we briefly review the evidence for modulatory effects of CGRP and SP in the sensory periphery.\n",

      "Abs: We have investigated the regulation of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release from trigeminal neurons by the serotonergic antimigraine drug sumatriptan. Serum levels of the neuropeptide CGRP are elevated during migraine. Treatment with the drug sumatriptan returns CGRP levels to normal coincident with the alleviation of headache. However, despite this clinical efficacy, the cellular target and mechanism of sumatriptan action are not well understood beyond the pharmacology of its recognition of the 5-HT1 class of serotonin receptors. We have used cultured trigeminal neurons to demonstrate that sumatriptan can directly repress CGRP secretion from sensory neurons. The stimulated secretion in response to depolarization or inflammatory agents was inhibited, but not the basal secretion rate. Unexpectedly, sumatriptan did not lower cAMP levels, in contrast to the classical role ascribed to the 5-HT1 receptors. Instead, activation of 5-HT1 receptors caused a slow and remarkably prolonged increase in intracellular calcium. The inhibition of CGRP secretion is attenuated by the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, suggesting that sumatriptan action is mediated by calcium-recruited phosphatases. These results suggest that 5-HT1 agonists may block a deleterious feedback loop in migraine at the trigeminal neurons and provide a general mechanism by which this class of drugs can attenuate stimulated neuropeptide release.\n",

      "PMID:  15210536\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), which leads to strokes and dementia, is caused by single missense mutations or, in a few cases, small deletions in the NOTCH3 gene. These mutations result in a gain or a loss of 1 (or, rarely, 3) cysteine residue in 1 of 34 epidermal growth factor-like repeats in the extracellular amino-terminal region of NOTCH3. OBJECTIVE: To describe a patient with a novel NOTCH3 mutation in whom clinical and laboratory findings of mitochondrial abnormalities were associated with a diagnosis of CADASIL. Patient A patient with a history of migraines, repeated transient ischemic attacks, and generalized fatigue underwent muscle biopsy, brain magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging, and screening of mitochondrial DNA and NOTCH3. RESULTS: Molecular genetic analysis showed a NOTCH3 mutation (the first documented frameshift deletion in a patient with CADASIL) in exon 4. Although the screening of mitochondrial DNA did not show mitochondrial mutations, findings from muscle biopsy and brain magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging showed signs of mitochondrial impairment (ultrastructural mitochondrial abnormalities and increased parenchymal brain lactate, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A patient with CADASIL and a 5-base pair deletion leading to a frameshift mutation showed clinical and laboratory evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction. This adds to the previously reported hypothesis of a pathogenetic role of NOTCH3 or, less specifically, a microvascular pathologic effect on mitochondrial energy metabolism.\n",

      "PMID:  10081978\n",
      "Abs: We have carried out an immunohistochemical study on the presence of neurokinin A (NKA) and substance P (SP) in the rat caudal trigeminal nucleus (CTN) after electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion (TG), used as an experimental model to induce alterations, some of which may occur during migraine attacks (release of vasoactive peptides from perivascular trigeminal axons and neurogenic inflammation). Both unilateral, 30 min electrical stimulation (5 Hz, 5 ms, 0.1-1 mA) of the TG and 5 min stimulation with a slight increase in the stimulating parameters (7.5 Hz, 5 ms, 1.4 mA) caused a significant depletion of the NKA and SP immunoreactivities (-IR) of the TG nerve central terminals in the ipsilateral CTN. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-IR of the ipsilateral CTN was also studied in the CTN using the increased stimulating parameters and a marked depletion of CGRP-IR was also observed following TG stimulation. Such depletion may be due to the release of neuropeptides from the trigeminal central terminals. These findings suggest that NKA, SP and CGRP could act as neurotransmitters at the first central synapses of the trigeminal nociceptive pathway to transmit the sensory stimuli to the higher brain centers.\n",

      "PMID:  2470872\n",
      "Abs: Trigeminal sensory innervation of cerebral vessels and the surrounding dura is responsible for most intracranial head pain. Small-diameter fibers containing substance P (Sub P) have been observed in the periadventitia around feline cerebral blood vessels, and it has been suggested that these fibers are the trigeminal substrate for vascular pain associated with cluster and migraine headaches. Calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) coexists with Sub P in some of these fibers and with some Sub P containing neurons in the trigeminal ganglion. In addition, a population of trigeminal neurons containing CGRP but not Sub P has been observed. We now report that the population of trigeminal ganglion cells projecting to the cerebral vasculature is enriched in CGRP-containing neurons, and especially in the population of neurons containing CGRP and not Sub P. Using retrograde tracing of fluorescent tracers combined with immunocytochemistry after explant culture, we found approximately 32% of trigeminal ganglion cells projecting to the cerebral vasculature contained CGRP. Approximately 18 and 17% of these cells contained Sub P and cholecystokinin (CCK), respectively. The 32% of ganglion cells projecting to the cerebral vasculature that contain CGRP stands in contrast to the 12% CGRP positive seen in the population of ganglion cells projecting out to another target (the forehead), and the 21 and 23% CGRP positive observed in the mandibular branch and entire ganglion, respectively. Sub P and CCK are not enriched in the trigeminal innervation of the vasculature compared with their presence in cells throughout the ganglia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "PMID:  10666545\n",
      "Abs: The central terminals of the primary sensory trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons projecting into the caudal trigeminal nucleus (CTN) of the rat exhibit neurokinin A (NKA)-, substance P (SP)-, and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-immunoreactivities (IRs). We stimulated the TG in the rat to induce some of the alterations which might occur during migraine (neurogenic inflammation). Under a stereotaxic apparatus and by means of a bipolar electrode, one-side TG of the animals were electrically stimulated (7.5 Hz, 5 ms, 0.8-1. 4 mA) with square pulses for 5 min. Then, using immunohistochemical methods, the lower medulla of each rat was studied for NKA-, SP- and CGRP-IRs. Light microscopic examination of brain-stem sequencial sections revealed a simultaneous decrease in the immunoreactivities of all neuropeptides (NKA, SP and CGRP) in the CTN ipsilateral to TG stimulation in comparison with the other (not stimulated) side CTN. It is suggested that this decrease in immunoreactivity would be due to the co-release of neuropeptides following noxious stimuli and that NKA, SP and CGRP might therefore act as co-transmitters or co-modulators at the first central synapses of the trigeminal sensory pathway.\n",

      "PMID:  31212292\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an autosomal-dominant, inherited, systemic, vascular disorder primarily involving the small arteries. It is characterized by migraine, recurrent ischemic strokes, cognitive decline, and dementia. Mutations in the Notch receptor 3 gene (NOTCH3) and the HtrA serine peptidase 1 gene (HTRA1) are 2 genetic causes for CADASIL. The NOTCH3 gene, located on chromosome 19p13.12, is the most common disease-causing gene in CADASIL. OBJECTIVE: To investigate genetic causes in 2 unrelated Han-Chinese patients with presentations strongly suggestive of CADASIL. METHODS: Exome sequencing was performed on both patients and potential pathogenic mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: This study reports on 2 unrelated Han-Chinese patients with presentations strongly suggestive of CADASIL, identifying that NOTCH3 mutations were the genetic cause. A common mutation, c.268C>T (p.Arg90Cys), and a novel mutation, c.331G>T (p.Gly111Cys) in the NOTCH3 gene, were detected and confirmed in the patients, respectively, and were predicted to be deleterious based on bioinformation analyses. CONCLUSIONS: We identified 2 NOTCH3 mutations as likely genetic causes for CADASIL in these 2 patients. Our findings broaden the mutational spectrum of the NOTCH3 gene accountable for CADASIL. Clinical manifestations supplemented with molecular genetic analyses are critical for accurate diagnosis, the provision of genetic counseling, and the development of therapies for CADASIL.CI - © 2019 S.

      "PMID:  12721871\n",
      "Abs: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a rare inherited cerebrovascular disease. The onset of clinical symptoms occurs with migraine with aura, transient ischemic attacks, recurrent subcortical ischemic infarcts, neuropsychiatric changes reaching subcortical dementia. Brain magnetic resonance images show multiple deep cerebral infarcts in white matter and basal ganglia and diffuse leukoencephalopathy. Neuropathologic hallmark consists of deposition of small electron dense granular patches related to the basement membrane of vascular smooth muscle cells with degeneration of smooth muscle cells and media and luminal obliteration. Recently, the genetic characteristics of this disorder have been reported. Missense mutations in notch3 gene localized in chromosome 19 are involved in its pathogenesis. Only three families from Spain have been reported. Here we describe a patient with typical clinical symptoms, neuroimaging and pathology of CADASIL. C406T (Arg110Cys) mutation in notch3 gene was found. We comment on the clinical symptoms of different members of the patient's family.\n",

      "PMID:  29807576\n",
      "Abs: Tryptophan is metabolized primarily via the kynurenine pathway (KP), which involves several enzymes, including indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, tryptophan 2,3 dioxygenase (TDO), kynurenine aminotransferases (KATs), kynurenine monooxygenase (KMO) etc. The majority of metabolites are neuroactive: some of them, such as kynurenic acid, show neuroprotective effects, while others contribute to free radical production, leading to neurodegeneration. Imbalance of the pathway is assumed to contribute to the development of several neurodegenerative diseases, psychiatric disorders, migraine and multiple sclerosis. Our aim was to summarize published data on genetic alterations of enzymes involved in the KP leading to disturbances of the pathway that can be related to different diseases. To achieve this, a PubMed literature search was performed for publications on genetic alterations of the KP enzymes upto April 2017. Several genetic alterations of the KP have been identified and have been proposed to be associated with diseases. Here we must emphasize that despite the large number of recognized genetic alterations, the number of firmly established causal relations with specific diseases is still small. The realization of this by those interested in the field is very important and finding such connections should be a major focus of related research. Polymorphisms of the genes encoding the enzymes of the KP have been associated with autism, multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia, and were shown to affect the immune response of patients with bacterial meningitis, just to mention a few. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review of the genetic alterations of the KP enzymes. We believe that the identification of genetic alterations underlying diseases has great value regarding both treatment and diagnostics in precision medicine, as this work can promote the understanding of pathological mechanisms, and might facilitate medicinal chemistry approaches to substitute missing components or correct the disturbed metabolite balance of KP.CI - Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

      "Title: Turn structures in CGRP C-terminal analogues promote stable arrangements of key residue side chains\n",
      "PMID:  11444978\n",
      "Abs: The 37-amino acid calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a potent endogenous vasodilator thought to be implicated in the genesis of migraine attack. CGRP antagonists may thus have therapeutic value for the treatment of migraine. The CGRP C-terminally derived peptide [D(31),P(34),F(35)]CGRP(27-37)-NH(2) was recently identified as a high-affinity hCGRP(1) receptor selective antagonist. Reasonable CGRP(1) affinity has also been demonstrated for several related analogues, including [D(31),A(34),F(35)]CGRP(27-37)-NH(2). In the study presented here, conformational and structural features in CGRP(27-37)-NH(2) analogues that are important for hCGRP(1) receptor binding were explored. Structure-activity studies carried out on [D(31),P(34),F(35)]CGRP(27-37)-NH(2) resulted in [D(31),P(34),F(35)]CGRP(30-37)-NH(2), the shortest reported CGRP C-terminal peptide analogue exhibiting reasonable hCGRP(1) receptor affinity (K(i) = 29.6 nM). Further removal of T(30) from the peptide's N-terminus greatly reduced receptor affinity from the nanomolar to micromolar range. Additional residues deemed critical for hCGRP(1) receptor binding were identified from an alanine scan of [A(34),F(35)]CGRP(28-37)-NH(2) and included V(32) and F(37). Replacement of the C-terminal amide in this same peptide with a carboxyl, furthermore, resulted in a greater than 50-fold reduction in hCGRP(1) affinity, thus suggesting a direct role for the amide moiety in receptor binding. The conformational properties of two classes of CGRP(27-37)-NH(2) peptides, [D(31),X(34),F(35)]CGRP(27-37)-NH(2) (X is A or P), were examined by NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling. A beta-turn centered on P(29) was a notable feature consistently observed among active peptides in both series. This turn led to exposure of the critical T(30) residue to the surrounding environment. Peptides in the A(34) series were additionally characterized by a stable C-terminal helical turn that resulted in the three important residues (T(30), V(32), and F(37)) adopting consistent interspatial positions with respect to one another. Peptides in the P(34) series were comparatively more flexible at the C-terminus, although a large proportion of the [D(31),P(34),F(35)]CGRP(27-37)-NH(2) calculated conformers contained a gamma-turn centered on P(34). These results collectively suggest that turn structures at both the C-terminus and N-terminus of CGRP(27-37)-NH(2) analogues may help to appropriately orient critical residues (T(30), V(32), and F(37)) for hCGRP(1) receptor binding.\n",

      "PMID:  29361895\n",
      "Abs: Epilepsy is the fourth most common neurological disease after migraine, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease. Approximately one-third of all epilepsy cases are refractory to the existing anticonvulsants. Thus, there is an unmet need for newer antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) to manage refractory epilepsy (RE). Discovery of novel AEDs for the treatment of RE further retards for want of potential pharmacological targets, unavailable due to unclear etiology of this disease. In this regard, network pharmacology as an area of bioinformatics is gaining popularity. It combines the methods of network biology and polypharmacology, which makes it a promising approach for finding new molecular targets. This work is aimed at discovering new pharmacological targets for the treatment of RE using network pharmacology methods. In the framework of our study, the genes associated with the development of RE were selected based on analysis of available data. The methods of network pharmacology were used to select 83 potential pharmacological targets linked to the selected genes. Then, 10 most promising targets were chosen based on analysis of published data. All selected target proteins participate in biological processes, which are considered to play a key role in the development of RE. For 9 of 10 selected targets, the potential associations with different kinds of epilepsy have been recently mentioned in the literature published, which gives additional evidence that the approach applied is rather promising.\n",

      "PMID:  32988380\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Headache is the dominant factor for quality of life related disability in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and typically has migraine-like characteristics. There are currently no evidence-based therapeutics for headache in IIH, and consequently this is an important unmet clinical need. CASE SERIES: We report a series of seven patients in whom headaches were the presenting feature of IIH and the headaches had migraine-like characteristics, as is typical in many IIH patients. Papilloedema settled (ocular remission) but headaches continued. These headaches responded markedly to erenumab, a monoclonal antibody targeted against the calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) receptor. Of note, there was a recurrence of raised ICP, as evidenced by a return of the papilloedema, however the headaches did not recur whilst treated with erenumab. CONCLUSIONS: Those with prior IIH who have their headaches successfully treated with CGRP therapy, should remain under close ocular surveillance (particularly when weight gain is evident) as papilloedema can re-occur in the absence of headache. These cases may suggest that CGRP could be a mechanistic driver for headache in patients with active IIH.\n",

      "PMID:  17670966\n",
      "Abs: The molecular mechanisms of migraine pain are incompletely understood, although migraine mediators such as NGF and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) are believed to play an algogenic role. Although NGF block is proposed as a novel analgesic approach, its consequences on nociceptive purinergic P2X receptors of trigeminal ganglion neurons remain unknown. We investigated whether neutralizing NGF might change the function of P2X3 receptors natively coexpressed with NGF receptors on cultured mouse trigeminal neurons. Treatment with an NGF antibody (24 h) decreased P2X3 receptor-mediated currents and Ca2+ transients, an effect opposite to exogenously applied NGF. Recovery from receptor desensitization was delayed by anti-NGF treatment without changing desensitization onset. NGF neutralization was associated with decreased threonine phosphorylation of P2X3 subunits, presumably accounting for their reduced responses and slower recovery. Anti-NGF treatment could also increase the residual current typical of heteromeric P2X2/3 receptors, consistent with enhanced membrane location of P2X2 subunits. This possibility was confirmed with cross-linking and immunoprecipitation studies. NGF neutralization also led to increased P2X2e splicing variant at mRNA and membrane protein levels. These data suggest that NGF controlled plasticity of P2X3 subunits and their membrane assembly with P2X2 subunits. Despite anti-NGF treatment, CGRP could still enhance P2X3 receptor activity, indicating separate NGF- or CGRP-mediated mechanisms to upregulate P2X3 receptors. In an in vivo model of mouse trigeminal pain, anti-NGF pretreatment suppressed responses evoked by P2X3 receptor activation. Our findings outline the important contribution by NGF signaling to nociception of trigeminal sensory neurons, which could be counteracted by anti-NGF pretreatment.\n",

      "Title: Characterizing the PK/PD relationship for inhibition of capsaicin-induced dermal vasodilatation by MK-3207, an oral calcitonin gene related peptide receptor antagonist\n",
      "PMID:  25377933\n",
      "Abs: AIMS: Calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists are effective acute migraine treatments. A capsaicin-induced dermal vasodilatation (CIDV) model has been developed to provide target-engagement information in healthy volunteers. In the model, CGRP release is provoked after dermal capsaicin application, by activating transient receptor potential vanilloid-type-1 (TRPV1) receptors at peripheral sensory nerves. Laser Doppler imaging is used to quantify CIDV and subsequent inhibition by CGRP receptor antagonists. We sought to evaluate a CGRP receptor antagonist, MK-3207, in the biomarker model and to assess the predictability of the CIDV response to migraine clinical efficacy. METHODS: An integrated population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model was developed to describe the exposure-response relationship for CIDV inhibition by CGRP and TRPV1 receptor antagonists. MK-3207 dose-response predictions were made based on estimated potency from the PK/PD model and mean plasma concentrations observed at the doses investigated. RESULTS: The results suggested that a 20 mg dose of MK-3207 (EC50 of 1.59 nm) would be required to attain the peripheral CIDV response at a target level that was shown previously to correlate with 2 h clinical efficacy based on phase 3 telcagepant clinical data, and that a plateau of the dose-response would be reached around 40-100 mg. These predictions provided a quantitative rationale for dose selection in a phase 2 clinical trial of MK-3207 and helped with interpretation of the efficacy results from the trial. CONCLUSIONS: The integrated CIDV PK/PD model provides a useful platform for characterization of PK/PD relationships and predictions of dose-response relationships to aid in future development of CGRP and TRPV1 receptor antagonists.CI - © 2014 The British Pharmacological Society.\n",

      "PMID:  16880765\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It has been suggested that during a migraine attack capsaicin-sensitive trigeminal sensory nerves release calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), resulting in cranial vasodilatation and central nociception; hence, trigeminal inhibition may prevent this vasodilatation and abort migraine headache. This study investigated the effects of the agonists sumatriptan (5-HT(1B/1D) water-soluble), donitriptan (5-HT(1B/1D) lipid-soluble), PNU-142633 (5-HT(1D) water-soluble) and PNU-109291 (5-HT(1D) lipid-soluble) on vasodilator responses to capsaicin, alpha-CGRP and acetylcholine in dog external carotid artery. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: 59 vagosympathectomized dogs were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded with a pressure transducer, connected to a cannula inserted into a femoral artery. A precalibrated flow probe was placed around the common carotid artery, with ligation of the internal carotid and occipital branches, and connected to an ultrasonic flowmeter. The thyroid artery was cannulated for infusion of agonists. KEY RESULTS: Intracarotid infusions of capsaicin, alpha-CGRP and acetylcholine dose-dependently increased blood flow through the carotid artery. These responses remained unaffected after intravenous (i.v.) infusions of sumatriptan, PNU-142633, PNU-109291 or physiological saline; in contrast, donitriptan significantly attenuated the vasodilator responses to capsaicin, but not those to alpha-CGRP or acetylcholine. Only sumatriptan and donitriptan dose-dependently decreased the carotid blood flow. Interestingly, i.v. administration of the antagonist, SB224289 (5-HT(1B)), but not of BRL15572 (5-HT(1D)), abolished the inhibition by donitriptan. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results suggest that the inhibition produced by donitriptan of capsaicin-induced external carotid vasodilatation is mainly mediated by 5-HT(1B), rather than 5-HT(1D), receptors, probably by a central mechanism.\n",

      "Abs: The relatively high percentages of patients with epilepsy, in whom seizures are uncontrolled in spite of optimal antiepileptic drug use, lead to continuous struggles to improve the treatment of epilepsy. The advances in defining the genetic basis of epilepsy can potentially lead to better understanding of the disorder as well as to more effective treatment. An example is the finding of SCN1A gene mutations in association with a large spectrum of neurological diseases, from generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS +) to severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy and to vaccine-induced encephalopathy and Rasmussen encephalitis, Panayiotopoulos syndrome and familial hemiplegic migraine. In parallel, throughout the world, imaging modalities of very high technology are being used to define the epileptogenic focus. A description from The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, of a topographic movie of high frequency oscillations on the brain surface, which allows visualization of the dynamic ictal changes, is remarkable. The ketogenic diet is a significant treatment option. The John Freeman Epilepsy Center in Johns Hopkins Hospital leads the way in using the diet in very young infants, including West syndrome. The vagus nerve stimulation is being used as another relatively safe and effective treatment, while epilepsy surgery continues to be applied. Better matching of patients to each modality can be expected with increased success in seizure control.\n",

      "Abs: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to investigate the effects of selective calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist (MK-8825) on cortical spreading depression (CSD) induced pain behavior and anxiety in freely-moving rats, and neuronal activation in the correlated anatomical regions. METHODS: CSD was induced while keeping all meningeal layers and BBB intact and MK-8825 was administered in two different doses. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), arterial pressure and DC shift were recorded. Behavioral studies were conducted in freely-moving rats. Spontaneous behavior, mechanical allodynia, ultrasonic vocalization, and anxiety were evaluated. Immunohistochemistry of c-fos, CGRP, calcitonin receptor like-receptor (CLR) and receptor activity modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) were studied. RESULTS: MK-8825 did not block DC shifts in the cerebral cortex and accompanied hemodynamic response. CSD significantly induced freezing and grooming behavior in freely-moving rats. MK-8825 reversed increased episodes of freezing, grooming, wet dog shake and head shake behavior. MK-8825 increased CSD-induced reductions in von Frey thresholds, but did not change elevated plus maze results. MK-8825 blocked c-fos induction by CSD in the brainstem trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) and reticular nucleus of thalamus (TRN) but not in the amygdala. Immunofluorescence analysis showed no co-localization of CGRP, CLR or RAMP1 with c-fos positive cells. CONCLUSION: CGRP receptor antagonist MK-8825 dose dependently attenuated CSD-induced trigeminal nerve mediated pain response without altering CSD waves and accompanied rCBF response. While blocking TNC activation, MK-8825 did not exert any effect on amygdala and anxiety behavior. CGRP receptor antagonists may also modulate thalamo-cortical gating.\n",

      "Abs: TWIK-related spinal cord K(+) channel (TRESK) is the gene product of KCNK18, the last discovered leak potassium K2P channel gene. Under resting conditions, TRESK is constitutively phosphorylated at two regulatory regions. Protein kinase A (PKA) and microtubule affinity-regulating (MARK) kinases can be applied in experiments to phosphorylate these sites of TRESK expressed in Xenopus oocytes, respectively. Upon generation of a calcium signal, TRESK is dephosphorylated and thereby activated by calcineurin. In this process, the binding of calcineurin to the channel by non-catalytic interacting sites is essential. The phosphorylation/dephosphorylation regulatory process is modified by 14-3-3 proteins. Human, but not murine TRESK is also activated by protein kinase C. TRESK is expressed most abundantly in sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal ganglia, and the channel modifies certain forms of nociceptive afferentation. In a large pedigree, a dominant negative mutant TRESK allele was found to co-segregate perfectly with migraine phenotype. While this genetic defect may be responsible only for a very small fraction of migraine cases, specific TRESK activation is expected to exert beneficial effect in common forms of the disease.\n",

      "PMID:  18460469\n",
      "Abs: The molecular mechanisms underlying migraine pain remain unclear and probably require sustained facilitation in pain-sensing P2X(3) receptors gated by extracellular ATP in nociceptive sensory neurons. The major migraine mediator calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is known to sensitize P2X(3) receptors to increase impulse flow to brainstem trigeminal nuclei. This process is mediated via changes in the expression and function of P2X(3) receptors initially through enhanced trafficking and, later, perhaps through augmented synthesis of P2X(3) receptors. To clarify the mechanisms responsible for CGRP-evoked long lasting alterations in P2X(3) receptors, we used as a model mouse trigeminal ganglion neurons in culture. CGRP activated Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent kinase II, which became localized to the perimembrane region and neuronal processes, a phenomenon already apparent after 30 min and accompanied by a parallel increase in cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. These effects triggered increased P2X(3) receptor transcription and were prevented by expressing a dominant negative form of CREB. Increased P2X(3) receptor synthesis was partly mediated by endogenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) because of its block by anti-BDNF antibodies and mimicry by exogenous BDNF. Immunocytochemistry experiments indicated distinct subpopulations of BDNF- or CGRP-sensitive trigeminal neurons with only partial overlap. The present data indicate a novel mechanism for enhancing P2X(3) receptor expression and function in trigeminal sensory neurons by CGRP via CREB phosphorylation. BDNF was an intermediate to extend the sensitizing effect of CGRP also to CGRP-insensitive neurons. This combinatorial action could serve as a powerful process to amplify and prolong pain mediated by P2X(3) receptors.\n",

      "PMID:  8177860\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a 37 amino acid peptide resulting from the specific maturation processes of calcitonin gene products, was discovered in 1982. Its messenger RNA was isolated from a calcitonin cancer in rats similar to the human thyroid medullary carcinoma. CGRP is closely related to calcitonin and amylin, and to a lesser extent, to the region coding for the alpha chains of relaxins, insulin and insulin growth factors. In thyroid C cells, calcitonin itself is the major gene product, but CGRP is predominant in the central and peripheral nervous system. CGRP is found in most all tissues and is considered to be a neuromediator of particular importance in the cardiovascular system. CGRP is a powerful endogenous vasodilator in man; plasma concentrations of 56 pmol/l (slightly above physiological levels) provoke flush, hypotension and secondary catecholamine release and subsequent tachycardia. Intravenous injections lead to systemic vasodilatation and redistribution of blood flow to the skin, the brain, and probably the splanchnic territory. It has been suggested that CGRP plays a role in blood pressure modulation in certain pathological conditions. CGRP level is decreased in hypertension and increased in septic shock. In patients with terminal renal failure, CGRP is correlated with excess volaemia. It could affect blood pressure by redistributing blood flow, interacting with the renin-angiotensin system or by inhibiting aldosterone secretion. CGRP may also play a role in modulating cutaneous vascular constriction in Raynaud's syndrome and cerebral vascularization in patients with migraine or meningeal hemorrhage subsequent to rupture of cerebral aneurisms. CGRP increases arterial flow in the cavernous body. Coronarian vascular tone and cardiac performance (positive chronotrope and inotrope effects) are improved. CGRP has also been studied in connection with glucose metabolism and may have other endocrine effects. Finally, CGRP increases electrolyte and water flow in the colon and its bronchoconstrictor effect could be implicated in asthma. The clinical significance of plasma CGRP is not yet known although it may be a marker of poor prognosis in thyroid medullary cancer. Recent studies suggest that CGRP could be a useful therapeutic agent in severe Raynaud syndrome, impotency, ischaemic neurological lesions due to ruptured aneurisms and in severe heart failure.\n",

      "Title: CGRP, Amylin, Immunology, and Headache Medicine\n",
      "PMID:  30390312\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) therapeutics introduce new excitement and possibly yet to be determined distressing discords in the field of Headache Medicine. Growth in knowledge of CGRP in the pathophysiology of migraine introduced CGRP antagonism to headache treatment. Potential adverse effects on the other circulatory and neurovascular diseases have been foremost concerns. Failures in development of gepants and growth in knowledge of monoclonal antibody therapeutics combined to deliver the anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). CURRENT SITUATION AS OF JULY 2018: Erenumab, eptinezumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab are approved, submitted to, or preparing for submission at both the European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). METHODS: This Headache Currents update emanates from a symposium on CGRP and immunology in Headache Medicine, and reviews both. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Understanding CGRP in Headache Medicine requires information on aspects of the CGRP ligand, cell surface G protein receptor, CGRP receptor specifics, and antagonism by CGRP small and large molecules. Recent reports of CGRP's high affinity for amylin receptors dictate some attention to this family-related peptide. To better understand potential immunogenic risks and off-target toxicities of the anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies, this review discusses immunology and CGRP and reviews IgG structure and function, monoclonal antibody production, ligand-antigen-antibody relationships, and clinical CGRP mAb specifics. Upon completion, the reader should better summarize CGRP antagonist fundamentals, recall antibody structure and function, restate therapeutic mAbs attributes, and appraise immunogenic risks.CI - © 2018 American Headache Society.\n",

      "PMID:  15612520\n",
      "Abs: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a neurodegenerative, monogenic, and autosomic dominant disease which is characterized by a global cerebellar atrophy. Typically the onset is at mature age and undergoes a moderate evolution. This illness has been associated with a mutation in the gene CACNA1A, that encodes for subunit alpha1A of P/Q type voltage/dependent calcium channel. The mutation results in the expansion of a CAG triplet repeat located in the last exon of the gene, which is translated into a polyglutamine chain in the carboxyl tail of the calcium channel subunit. Several studies have been made to clarify the mechanism for the toxicity of polyglutamines in cerebellar neurons; SCA6 could be considered a polyglutamine proteinopathy linked to caspases mediated death pathway. However, SCA6 is also considered a channelopathy, like paroxysmal diseases as hemiplegic familiar migraine and episodic ataxia type 2. The goal of this review is to analyze the intracellular mechanism triggering neuronal death in cerebellum, and the subsequent neurodegeneration.\n",

      "PMID:  19864665\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: To describe aspects in clinical and genetic presentation in five patients with episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2). METHODS: CACNA1A gene screening identified a mutation in three probands and in two of their children. RESULTS: The three probands had attacks of imbalance, associated with dizziness/vertigo and/or headache. Two of them had independent migraine attacks. Interictal oculomotor examination revealed a gaze evoked nystagmus and central oculomotor signs. Two probands had a history of strabismus. All responded well to acetazolamide. Two children were found to have both clinical and genetic abnormalities. At 23 months, one child started to have short attacks of imbalance mimicking benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood. Then, the frequency and duration of his attacks increased and some were associated with headache. The other child developed permanent imbalance with falls at the age of 2 years, strabismus, hyperactivity and slight to moderate cognitive deficiency. When aged 10 years, this was further complicated by episodic ataxia. Genetic analysis revealed three novel mutations in the calcium channel gene CACNA1A (chromosome 19p13). The two children had the same genetic abnormality as their parents. CONCLUSION: EA2 may present with still unknown genetic mutations in adults, and with large and various phenotypes in children, such as short attacks of imbalance or permanent imbalance, cognitive deficiency, and possibly strabismus and hyperactivity.\n",

      "PMID:  19576955\n",
      "Abs: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a heritable small-vessel disease caused by mutations in NOTCH3 gene and clinically characterized by recurrent ischemic strokes, migraine with aura, psychiatric symptoms, cognitive decline and dementia. Direct sequencing of NOTCH3 gene in 90 Italian patients of sixty-three unrelated families identified four heterozygous mutations (R141C and C144F in exon 4, G528C in exon 10 and R1006C in exon 19) in fifteen probands and sixteen relatives. We detected seventeen heterozygous/homozygous polymorphisms, four of them novel. Here we report the high recurrence of R1006C mutation in ten families all originate from a restricted area of central Italy, the town of Ascoli Piceno and same neighbour villages. We also developed a PCR-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) assay to analyze the R1006C mutation. Our findings might suggest, for this mutation, the presence of a common ancestor.\n",

      "Abs: High-throughput screening of the Merck sample collection identified benzodiazepinone tetralin-spirohydantoin 1 as a CGRP receptor antagonist with micromolar activity. Comparing the structure of 1 with those of earlier peptide-based antagonists such as BIBN 4096 BS, a key hydrogen bond donor-acceptor pharmacophore was hypothesized. Subsequent structure activity studies supported this hypothesis and led to benzodiazepinone piperidinyldihydroquinazolinone 7, CGRP receptor K(i)=44nM and IC(50)=38nM. Compound 7 was orally bioavailabile in rats and is a lead in the development of orally bioavailable CGRP antagonists for the treatment of migraine.\n",

      "Abs: In migraine and other primary headaches there is a strong vascular component. Besides the trigeminovascular components some of the associated symptoms point to the involvement of brain stem regions. The central limb of the trigeminal vascular pathway is its projection to the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) and to the C1-C2 levels of the spinal cord. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the occurrence of some neurotransmitters in these regions in man. In both the TNC and in the Rexed's laminae I and II of the dorsal horns at the C1 and C2 levels there were numerous substance P immunoreactive fibres. Fibres containing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) were moderately dense in number. Fibres containing vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) or nitric oxide synthase (NOS) were not seen in the TNC or at the C1 and C2 levels of the spinal cord.\n",

      "PMID:  25323668\n",
      "Abs: CADASIL and CARASIL are hereditary small vessel diseases leading to vascular dementia. CADASIL commonly begins with migraine followed by minor strokes in mid-adulthood. Dominantly inherited CADASIL is caused by mutations (n > 230) in NOTCH3 gene, which encodes Notch3 receptor expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Notch3 extracellular domain (N3ECD) accumulates in arterial walls followed by VSMC degeneration and subsequent fibrosis and stenosis of arterioles, predominantly in cerebral white matter, where characteristic ischemic MRI changes and lacunar infarcts emerge. The likely pathogenesis of CADASIL is toxic gain of function related to mutation-induced unpaired cysteine in N3ECD. Definite diagnosis is made by molecular genetics but is also possible by electron microscopic demonstration of pathognomonic granular osmiophilic material at VSMCs or by positive immunohistochemistry for N3ECD in dermal arteries. In rare, recessively inherited CARASIL the clinical picture and white matter changes are similar as in CADASIL, but cognitive decline begins earlier. In addition, gait disturbance, low back pain and alopecia are characteristic features. CARASIL is caused by mutations (presently n = 10) in high-temperature requirement.

      "Title: CADASIL: hereditary disease of arteries causing brain infarcts and dementia\n",
      "PMID:  10476042\n",
      "Abs: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) begins with migraine with aura in approximately one-third of the patients. More severe symptoms of recurrent strokes usually appear at 30-50 years of age. However, well before the first stroke, CADASIL may be diagnosed on the basis of characteristic hyperintensities in T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. Multiple lacunar infarcts located mainly in the basal ganglia and frontal white matter lead to a cognitive decline and finally to dementia. These infarcts result from a thickening and fibrosis of the walls of the small and medium-sized penetrating arteries with consequent obliteration and/or thrombosis. Although the symptoms are almost exclusively neurological, the arteriopathy is generalized. Thus, basophilic, periodic acid-Schiff-positive and, in electron microscopy, osmiophilic material accumulates between degenerating smooth muscle cells. This occurs even in dermal arteries, which renders skin a useful target for diagnostic biopsy. Presently, no specific therapy is available. CADASIL is caused by missense point mutations in the Notch3 gene, which encodes a transmembrane receptor protein. Each gene defect leads to either a gain or loss of a cysteine residue in the extracellular, N-terminal domain of the molecule, which most probably results in conformational alteration. The function of Notch3 in adults and the pathogenesis of CADASIL are still unknown.\n",

      "PMID:  11916749\n",
      "Abs: As many as one-third of mutations in a gene result in the corresponding enzyme having an increased Michaelis constant, or K(m), (decreased binding affinity) for a coenzyme, resulting in a lower rate of reaction. About 50 human genetic dis-eases due to defective enzymes can be remedied or ameliorated by the administration of high doses of the vitamin component of the corresponding coenzyme, which at least partially restores enzymatic activity. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms, in which the variant amino acid reduces coenzyme binding and thus enzymatic activity, are likely to be remediable by raising cellular concentrations of the cofactor through high-dose vitamin therapy. Some examples include the alanine-to-valine substitution at codon 222 (Ala222-->Val) [DNA: C-to-T substitution at nucleo-tide 677 (677C-->T)] in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (NADPH) and the cofactor FAD (in relation to cardiovascular disease, migraines, and rages), the Pro187-->Ser (DNA: 609C-->T) mutation in NAD(P):quinone oxidoreductase 1 [NAD(P)H dehy-drogenase (quinone)] and FAD (in relation to cancer), the Ala44-->Gly (DNA: 131C-->G) mutation in glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase and NADP (in relation to favism and hemolytic anemia), and the Glu487-->Lys mutation (present in one-half of Asians) in aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD + ) and NAD (in relation to alcohol intolerance, Alzheimer disease, and cancer).\n",

      "PMID:  25118673\n",
      "Abs: INTRODUCTION: Altered homeostasis of cell calcium movement is a central stage in multiple diseases of CNS. This explains the great therapeutic interest in blockers for the various subtypes of voltage-activated calcium channels (VACCs) expressed in neurons. Mitigation of Ca(2+) entry excess elicited by those blockers may restore the altered synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity and gene expression to normal parameters, ending the enhanced neuronal vulnerability. AREAS COVERED: This review summarize 23 patents on ligands for L-, N- or T-type channels, claimed to have potential therapeutic interest in epilepsy, pain, migraine and neurodegenerative diseases. EXPERT OPINION: Collections of compounds are generally screened in cell lines expressing a given subtype of VACCs. IC50 to block such channels are often, but not always, provided. In few instances, compounds exhibiting the highest potency in in vitro experiments are also tested in animal models of pain, behavior, epilepsy or Alzheimer's disease. Attempts to develop selectivity for a given VACC subtype with non-peptidic organic ligands have so far failed. Due to their wide tissue expression, such selectivity is crucial for minimizing possible side effects. However, the few data reported by patents does not allow prediction of selectivity of the new compounds in many cases.\n",

      "PMID:  19266171\n",
      "Abs: Triptans are effective and well tolerated in acute migraine management but their exact mechanism of action is still debated. Triptans might exert their antimigraine effect by reducing the levels of circulating calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). To examine this question, we examined whether sumatriptan modulate the baseline CGRP levels in vivo, under conditions without trigeminovascular system activation. We sampled blood from the internal and external jugular, the cubital veins, and the radial artery before and after administration of subcutaneous sumatriptan in 16 healthy volunteers. Repeated-measure ANOVA showed no interaction between catheter and time of sampling and thus no significant difference in CGRP between the four catheters (P=0.75). CGRP did not change over time in the four compartments (P>0.05). The relative changes in CGRP between baseline and maximal sumatriptan concentration did not differ between the four vascular compartments (P=0.49). It was found that Sumatriptan did not change the levels of circulating CGRP in the intra or extracerebral circulation in healthy volunteers. This speaks against a direct CGRP-reducing effect of sumatriptan in vivo in humans when the trigemino vascular system is not activated.\n",

      "PMID:  22539824\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is regarded as a key mediator in the generation of primary headaches. CGRP receptor antagonists reduce migraine pain in clinical trials and spinal trigeminal activity in animal experiments. The site of CGRP receptor inhibition causing these effects is debated. Activation and inhibition of CGRP receptors in the trigeminal ganglion may influence the activity of trigeminal afferents and hence of spinal trigeminal neurons. In anesthetized rats extracellular activity was recorded from neurons with meningeal afferent input in the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis. Mechanical stimuli were applied at regular intervals to receptive fields located in the exposed cranial dura mater. α-CGRP (10(-5) M), the CGRP receptor antagonist olcegepant (10(-3) M), or vehicle was injected through the infraorbital canal into the trigeminal ganglion. The injection of volumes caused transient discharges, but vehicle, CGRP, or olcegepant injection was not followed by significant changes in ongoing or mechanically evoked activity. In animals pretreated intravenously with the nitric oxide donor glyceryl trinitrate (GTN, 250 μg/kg) the mechanically evoked activity decreased after injection of CGRP and increased after injection of olcegepant. In conclusion, the activity of spinal trigeminal neurons with meningeal afferent input is normally not controlled by CGRP receptor activation or inhibition in the trigeminal ganglion. CGRP receptors in the trigeminal ganglion may influence neuronal activity evoked by mechanical stimulation of meningeal afferents only after pretreatment with GTN. Since it has previously been shown that olcegepant applied to the cranial dura mater is ineffective, trigeminal activity driven by meningeal afferent input is more likely to be controlled by CGRP receptors located centrally to the trigeminal ganglion.\n",

      "Title: CGRP, a vasodilator neuropeptide that stimulates neuromuscular transmission and EC coupling\n",
      "PMID:  19485922\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) is a vasodilator; its plasma levels are altered in several human diseases, including migraine, hypertension and diabetes. CGRP is locally released by motor neurons, and is overexpressed in response to surgical or pharmacological blockage of neuromuscular transmission. Additionally to a brief discussion with regard to the clinical relevance of CGRP, this review focuses on the effects of CGRP on skeletal muscle excitation-contraction (EC) coupling, as well as the corresponding pathophysiological consequences. EC coupling involves activation of 2 different types of calcium channels: dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs) located at the sarcolemma, and ryanodine receptors (RyR1s) located at the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). In response to electrical depolarization, DHPRs activate nearby and physically bound RyR1s, allowing Ca(2+) from the SR to move into the cytosol (termed voltage-gated Ca(2+) release, or VGCR). We recently found that CGRP stimulates VGCR by 350 % in as short as 1h. This effect, which lasts for at least 48 h, is due to activation of the CGRP receptor, and requires activation of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. CGRP also increases the amplitude of caffeine-induced Ca(2+) release (400 %); suggesting increased SR Ca(2+) content underlies stimulation of VGCR. Interestingly, in the long-term CGRP also increases the density of sarcolemmal DHPRs (up to 30%, within 24-48 h). We propose that these CGRP effects may contribute to prevent and/or restore symptoms in central core disease (CCD); a congenital myopathy that is linked to mutations in the gene encoding RyR1.\n",

      "PMID:  27301493\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Cancer pain is associated with increased pain sensitivity to noxious (hyperalgesia) and normally innocuous (allodynia) stimuli due to activation of nociceptors by tumour-derived mediators or tumour infiltration of nerves. The pain sensitization is accompanied by modifications in gene expression, but specifically regulated genes are largely unknown. The 25 kDa synaptosomal-associated protein (SNAP-25) is involved in chemical neurotransmission at the synaptic cleft. Its inhibition by Botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) has been associated with antinociceptive effects in migraine, inflammatory and neuropathic pain. However, its potential to reduce tumour-associated pain remains to be clarified. METHODS: We applied a melanoma model of tumour pain in C57BL/6 mice and investigated SNAP-25 expression and regulation by qRT-PCR, Western Blot and immunofluorescence as well as tumour-associated mechanical allodynia with and without BoNT/A treatment. RESULTS: We found increased SNAP-25 expression in the dorsal root ganglia and the sciatic nerve. Intraplantar injection of BoNT/A induced the cleavage of SNAP-25 in these tissues and was associated with decreased mechanical allodynia after therapeutic treatment at early and late stages of tumour pain while the tumour size was not affected. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that SNAP-25 plays a role in tumour pain but has no influence on the initiation and progression of skin cancer. Its cleavage inhibits the development of allodynia in the mouse melanoma model and might be useful as new therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancer pain. WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD?: SNAP-25 is differentially regulated during melanoma-induced tumour pain. Its cleavage by BoNT/A might be a suitable therapeutic option for tumour pain patients since tumour-associated pain can be strongly and significantly reduced after preventive and therapeutic BoNT/A treatment, respectively.CI - © 2016 European Pain Federation - EFIC®.\n",

      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays an important role in the transmission and modulation of nociceptive information in the spinal cord. BIBN4096BS, a nonpeptide CGRP receptor antagonist, has been shown to be efficiency in clinical migraine treatment. The present study was performed to investigate the effects of BIBN4096BS on the CGRP-induced inhibition to whole-cell K(+) currents in spinal wide dynamic range (WDR) neuron of rats. Application of BIBN4096BS inhibited the neuronal activity of WDR neurons in lumbar dorsal horn of the spinal cord in rats tested by extracellular recording method. Furthermore, CGRP induced inhibition on whole-cell K(+) currents in cultured dorsal horn neurons of rats tested by whole-cell patch-clamp recording, and the effect was significantly blocked by BIBN4096BS. The results indicate that BIBN4096BS may produce antinociceptive effects at the spinal level in rats.CI - (c) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "PMID:  9209773\n",
      "Abs: This study describes a novel intravital microscope technique for direct measurement of dural blood vessel diameter through a closed cranial window in anaesthetized rats. This technique avoids removal of the skull, which can lead to problems of altered vessel reactivity and brain swelling that are encountered with open cranial window techniques. Substance P and calcitonin gene-related (CGRP) evoked increases in dural vessel diameter, which were abolished by the NK1 receptor antagonist, RP67580 and the CGRP receptor antagonist, human-alpha CGRP(8-37) respectively. Neurokinin A produced increases in dural vessel diameter which were unaffected by the NK2 receptor antagonist SR 48968 but were blocked by RP67580, suggesting that neurokinin A can act through NK1 receptors to produce dural vasodilation in rats. The NK3 receptor agonist, senktide, had no effects on dural vessel diameter. All drugs were administered intravenously. In humans, vasodilation within the meningeal vasculature has been implicated in the pathogenesis of migraine, the present experiments indicate that substance P or neurokinin A (both acting through NK1 receptors) or CGRP may be responsible.\n",

      "PMID:  19055511\n",
      "Abs: Infusion of nitric oxide (NO) donors is known to induce delayed attacks of migraine and cluster headache or aggravate tension-type headaches in patients suffering from these primary headaches. Previously we have reported that infusion of NO donors in the rat causes delayed neuronal activity in the spinal trigeminal nucleus, which parallels the above clinical observations. Suggesting that endogenous NO production is involved in the generation of primary headaches, we used this animal model of meningeal nociception to determine whether a prolonged increase in NO levels causes an increase in neuronal activity. In anaesthetized rats spinal trigeminal neurons with afferent input from the exposed dura were recorded. Continuous intravenous infusion of the NO donors sodium nitroprusside (25 microg/kg/h) or glycerol trinitrate (250 microg/kg/h) for 2 h induced a persisting increase in neuronal activity but no change in systemic blood pressure. In this activated trigeminal system the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist BIBN4096BS (900 microg/kg) was infused. Spinal trigeminal activity was significantly reduced within minutes and to a similar extent as previously reported in animals not treated with NO. Slow continuous NO infusion may be a model of the active headache phase, and inhibition of CGRP receptors can reverse the induced neuronal activity.\n",

      "PMID:  25247292\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) cleave phosphodiester bonds in cyclic nucleotides and play diverse roles in cell biology. PDE5A is a cytoplasmic phosphodiesterase which specifically degrades cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a cell signaling molecule that plays important roles in neuronal signaling and vascular smooth muscle contraction. Inhibition of PDE5A induces headache resembling migraine headaches. AIM: To test the hypothesis that Ser102 and Ser104 in PDE5A and/or their phosphoserine derivatives 1) regulate the intracellular localization and/or activity of PDE5A, and 2) modulate the interaction between PDE5A and pharmaceutical reagents in clinical or pre-clinical use for migraine headaches and other types of vascular dysfunction. METHODS: Wild type PDE5A or PDE5A with substitution mutations (Ser102Ala, Ser104Ala or Ser102Ala/Ser104Ala) were overexpressed in SK-N-AS neuroblastoma cells as C-terminal fusions with green fluorescent protein. Transfected cells were treated with sildenafil, cilostazol, glyceryl trinitrate, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) or sumatriptan. PDE5A-GFP fusion proteins were localized in fixed cells by immunofluorescence and PDE activity was quantified in cell extracts by standard in vitro assay using [3H] cGMP. RESULTS: The intracellular distribution of wild-type, single and double mutant PDE5A was similar and was not altered by exposure to sildenafil, cilostazol, glyceryl trinitrate, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) or sumatriptan. PDE5 activity was similar for wild type, Ser102Ala and Ser104Ala PDE5A, but activity of the Ser102Ala/Ser104Ala mutant was approximately two-fold higher than wild type. Double mutant Ser102Ala/Ser104Ala migrated as a single band on a native acrylamide gel, while wild-type and single mutant PDE5A migrated as a doublet. INTERPRETATION: Ser102 and Ser104 may influence the conformational flexibility of PDE5A, which may in turn influence phosphorylation status, allosteric regulation by cGMP or other as yet unknown regulatory mechanisms for PDE5A. PDE5A activation could be important in reversal of migraine-like headache.\n",

The mother had a pure progressive cerebellar ataxia of late onset with downbeat nystagmus, whereas her daughter suffered from episodic ataxia, hemiplegic migraine, and progressive cerebellar ataxia with horizontal gaze-evoked and rebound nystagmus. In both patients, treatment with acetazolamide was ineffective and worsened baseline ataxia, whereas flunarizine ameliorated episodic symptoms.

      "PMID:  19012224\n",
      "Abs: Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactacidosis and stroke-like episode (MELAS) syndrome is a phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous mitochondrial disorder with a clinical onset between the first and third decade. The clinical hallmark is the stroke-like-episode, which mimicks ischemic stroke but is usually transient and non-disabling in nature. The morphological equivalent on MRI is a T2-hyperintensity, predominantly over the temporo-parieto-occipital region, not confined to a vascular territory, which is also hyperintense on diffusion weighted imaging and on apparent diffusion coefficient sequences (vasogenic edema, stroke-like lesion). Additional features include seizures, cognitive decline, psychosis, lactic acidosis, migraine, visual impairment, hearing loss, short stature, diabetes, or myopathy. Muscle biopsy typically shows ragged-red fibers, COX-negative fibers, SDH hyperreactivity, and abnormally shaped mitochondria with paracristalline inclusions. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of a biochemical respiratory chain defect or one of the disease-causing mutations, of which 80 % affect the mitochondrial tRNALeu gene.\n",

      "Abs: Autosomal dominant episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2) results from mutations of the CACNA1A gene. We describe EA2 with unusual features in a father and daughter with a novel CACNA1A mutation coding for Y248C. Both patients showed severe cerebellar atrophy in MRI and clinical signs of progressive spinocerebellar atrophy type 6. Most disabling were the very frequent episodes of ataxia with migraine (with aura in the father and without aura in the daughter) and nystagmus in our patients. Additionally, they suffered from ictal hyperhidrosis with acute hypothermia of the extremities. Lastly, the father presented with interictal chronic diarrhea not associated to a known primary gastrointestinal disorder. Both ictal hyperhidrosis and interictal diarrhea ameliorated upon acetazolamide intake, the typical treatment for EA2. The significance of these findings is discussed and the phenotype correlated to previously reported cases.\n",

      "PMID:  9209774\n",
      "Abs: This study used intravital microscopy to measure the diameter of dural arteries in anaesthetized rats. Electrical stimulation of the surface of a closed cranial window produced increases in dural vessel diameter which were blocked by the CGRP receptor antagonist human-alpha CGRP(8-37) but unaffected by the NK1 receptor antagonist RP67580. Sumatriptan (3 and 10 mg kg-1, i.v.) significantly reduced the response to electrical stimulation. In contrast, sumatriptan (3 mg kg-1) had no effects on the response to exogenously administered CGRP. These results indicate that neurokinins play no role in neurogenic vasodilation in this preparation and that neurogenic vasodilation in rat dural vessels is mediated predominantly by CGRP. Furthermore, the data indicate that sumatriptan attenuates neurogenic vasodilation, probably by inhibiting the release of CGRP from perivascular trigeminal nerve endings innervating the dura. These experimental data parallel the clinical findings that CGRP levels are elevated in migraine and normalized, concomitantly with headache relief, by sumatriptan.\n",

      "PMID:  23889991\n",
      "Abs: Astrocyte-elevated gene-1 (AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC) is a potent oncogene that regulates key cellular processes underlying disease of the central nervous system (CNS). From its involvement in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection to its role in neurodegenerative disease and malignant brain tumors, AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC facilitates cellular survival and proliferation through the control of a multitude of molecular signaling cascades. AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC induction by HIV-1 and TNF highlights its importance in viral infection, and its incorporation into viral vesicles supports its potential role in active viral replication. Overexpression of AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC in the brains of Huntington's disease patients suggests its function in neurodegenerative disease, and its association with genetic polymorphisms in large genome-wide association studies of migraine patients suggests a possible role in the pathogenesis of migraine headaches. In the field of cancer, AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC promotes angiogenesis, migration, invasion, and enhanced tumor metabolism through key oncogenic signaling cascades. In response to external stress cues and cellular mechanisms to inhibit further growth, AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC activates pathways that bypass cell checkpoints and potentiates signals to enhance survival and tumorigenesis. As an oncogene that promotes aberrant cellular processes within the CNS, AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC represents an important therapeutic target for the treatment of neurological disease.CI - Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical presentations, pathological features, imaging manifestation and genetic mutation of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). METHODS: A systematic study on the clinical manifestations, neuroimaging characteristics, pathology and molecular genetics was performed in the proband and 16 members of the family. An investigation on the hereditary pattern of the family tree of the proband was also conducted. RESULTS: The main clinical features including history of ischemic stroke attack, migraine, psychological disoders and dementia were noted. No risk factors of hypertension and arteriosclerosis were found. Pedigree maps of the index case were consistent with classical autosomal dominant inheritance. Subcortical multi-infarct lesions, leukoencephalopathy, O'Sullivan sign and \"Herringbone pattern\"shape sign were observed via cranial MRI analysis. By electron microscopy, skin biopsy indicated the characteristic deposition of granular osmiophilic material (GOM) on the basement of smooth muscle cells of arterioles in the proband. The mutation of C144Y in the fourth exon of notch 3 gene was revealed in three cases, including 1 patient with normal MRI. CONCLUSION: The pedigree is diagnosed with CADASIL. The main cause can be attributed to a mutation of C144Y in the fourth exon of Notch 3 gene. The pedigree has enriched Chinese database of CADASIL.\n",

      "PMID:  20855361\n",
      "Abs: INTRODUCTION: Lasmiditan (also known as COL-144 and LY573144; 2,4,6-trifluoro-N-[6-[(1-methylpiperidin-4-yl)carbonyl]pyridin-2yl]benzamide) is a high-affinity, highly selective serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT(1F) receptor agonist. RESULTS: In vitro binding studies show a K(i) value of 2.21 nM at the 5-HT(1F) receptor, compared with K(i) values of 1043 nM and 1357 nM at the 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(1D) receptors, respectively, a selectivity ratio greater than 470-fold. Lasmiditan showed higher selectivity for the 5-HT(1F) receptor relative to other 5-HT(1) receptor subtypes than the first generation 5-HT(1F) receptor agonist LY334370. Unlike the 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist sumatriptan, lasmiditan did not contract rabbit saphenous vein rings, a surrogate assay for human coronary artery constriction, at concentrations up to 100 µM. In two rodent models of migraine, oral administration of lasmiditan potently inhibited markers associated with electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion (dural plasma protein extravasation, and induction of the immediate early gene c-Fos in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis). CONCLUSIONS: Lasmiditan presents a unique pyridinoyl-piperidine scaffold not found in any other antimigraine class. Its chemical structure and pharmacological profile clearly distinguish it from the triptans. The potency and selectivity of lasmiditan make it ideally suited to definitively test the involvement of 5-HT(1F) receptors in migraine headache therapy.\n",

      "PMID:  17588559\n",
      "Abs: Functional serotonin (5-HT) and histamine receptor subtypes were investigated in porcine middle cerebral and ciliary arteries. An H(1) antagonist, mepyramine, antagonized histamine-induced responses with pK(B) values of 8.91-9.10. In the presence of 1 muM mepyramine, however, histamine caused dilation through H(2) receptors in the middle cerebral but not in the ciliary artery. A 5-HT(2A) antagonist, ketanserin, antagonized 5-HT-induced responses, causing rightward shifts in the concentration-response curves with pK(B) values of 8.52-8.71. A 5-HT(1B) antagonist, SB224289, produced rightward shifts of the concentration-response curves to sumatriptan with pK(B) values (6.66) only in the middle cerebral artery. In contrast, a 5-HT(1D) antagonist, BRL15572, had no effect in either artery. An RT-PCR study demonstrated the gene expression of the mRNAs of all three receptors (5HT(1B), 5HT(1D) and 5HT(2A)) in both arteries. These results suggest that histamine-induced contraction is mediated only through functional H(1) receptor in these arteries. Interestingly, there are functional 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(1B) receptor subtypes in the middle cerebral artery, whereas the only functional receptor is 5-HT(2A) in the ciliary artery. The difference may be important for treatment with 5-HT(1B/1D) agonists (e.g. for migraine) without ocular side effect.\n",

      "Abs: Substance P- and calcitonin gene-related peptide-like immunoreactivities (SP-LI and CGRP-LI, respectively) were measured in superfusates of either superior sagittal sinus and transverse sinuses and attached dura mater or dura mater alone of guinea pig. Exposure of cerebral venous sinuses to capsaicin (1 microM) evoked the release of both SP-LI and CGRP-LI, which was no longer observed upon second challenge with the drug. Neuropeptide release was induced by 80 mM K+ either at the first or second administration. Bradykinin (10 microM) increased the outflow of CGRP-LI, but not of SP-LI, from cerebral venous sinuses. In vitro capsaicin pretreatment (10 microM) or incubation with 10 microM indomethacin completely abolished the bradykinin-evoked CGRP-LI release. Capsaicin (1 microM) failed to evoke release from dura mater without major intracranial venous vessels. Sensory neuropeptide released from the cerebral venous sinuses may take part in certain symptoms, such as vasodilatation and inflammation accompanying the pain of the migraine attack. Bradykinin, putatively via prostanoid generation, may participate in this event.\n",

      "PMID:  23686557\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: Preclinical evaluation of headache by behavioral assessment of reward from pain relief. METHODS: Inflammatory mediators (IMs) or control solution were applied to the rat dura mater to elicit a presumed state of cephalic pain. Hind paw incision was used in separate groups of animals to model noncephalic postsurgical pain. Drugs were given systemically or microinjected within the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), nucleus accumbens (NAc), or rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC). Peripheral nerve block was produced at the level of the popliteal fossa, and behavior was assessed using evoked sensory stimuli or conditioned place preference (CPP). Immunohistochemistry and brain microdialysis measurements were performed. RESULTS: Dural IMs produced long-lasting generalized cutaneous allodynia. RVM lidocaine produced CPP, increased NAc c-Fos, and dopamine release selectively in rats receiving dural IMs; CPP was blocked by intra-NAc α-flupenthixol, a dopaminergic antagonist. Intravenous α-calcitonin gene-related peptide (αCGRP)(8-37) produced CPP and elicited NAc dopamine release selectively in rats treated with dural IMs. Prior lesion of the rACC or treatment with systemic sumatriptan or αCGRP(8-37) abolished RVM lidocaine-induced CPP in IM-treated rats. Sumatriptan treatment blocked NAc dopamine release in IM-treated rats receiving RVM lidocaine. Systemic sumatriptan did not alter pain relief-induced CPP in rats with incisional injury. INTERPRETATION: Cephalic pain was unmasked in rats by assessment of motivated behavior to seek relief. Relief of pain activates the dopaminergic reward pathway to elicit negative reinforcement of behavior. Medications clinically effective for migraine headache selectively elicit relief of ongoing cephalic, but not postsurgical, noncephalic pain. These studies provide a platform for exploring migraine pathophysiology and for the discovery of new headache therapies.CI - © 2013 American Neurological Association.\n",

      "PMID:  15269340\n",
      "Abs: This review summarizes the receptor-mediated vascular activities of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and the structurally related peptide adrenomedullin (AM). CGRP is a 37-amino acid neuropeptide, primarily released from sensory nerves, whilst AM is produced by stimulated vascular cells, and amylin is secreted from the pancreas. They share vasodilator activity, albeit to varying extents depending on species and tissue. In particular, CGRP has potent activity in the cerebral circulation, which is possibly relevant to the pathology of migraine, whilst vascular sources of AM contribute to dysfunction in cardiovascular disease. Both peptides exhibit potent activity in microvascular beds. All three peptides can act on a family of CGRP receptors that consist of calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CL) linked to one of three receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) that are essential for functional activity. The association of CL with RAMP1 produces a CGRP receptor, with RAMP2 an AM receptor and with RAMP3 a CGRP/AM receptor. Evidence for the selective activity of the first nonpeptide CGRP antagonist BIBN4096BS for the CGRP receptor is presented. The cardiovascular activity of these peptides in a range of species and in human clinical conditions is detailed, and potential therapeutic applications based on use of antagonists and gene targeting of agonists are discussed.\n",

      "PMID:  10772044\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Severe heart valve disorder has been reported in patients receiving a combination of the anorectic drugs fenfluramine and phentermine. The exact molecular mechanisms involved remain unknown. Fenfluramine alters the serotonin level in the brain, while phentermine interferes with the pulmonary clearance of serotonin; these data suggest that serotonin levels affect regulation of valve function. The aim of the present study was to characterize the serotonin receptor (5-hydroxytryptamine) subtypes expressed in the interstitial cells of human heart valves. METHODS: Interstitial cells were isolated and cultured from the aortic, pulmonary, mitral and tricuspid valves of recipient hearts obtained during transplantation. Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells in order to determine gene expression by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) subtype-specific primer pairs. RESULTS: The results show that: (i) 5-HT 1B and 1D receptor subtypes are expressed in all four heart valves. This is significant as the 1B and 1D receptor subfamilies are the target of the anti-migraine drug sumatriptan, and these receptors regulate cardiac function and movement; (ii) 5-HT 1A, 5-HT 1E and 5-HT 1F are not expressed in interstitial cells isolated from the valves. CONCLUSION: We conclude that preliminary evidence exists for the presence of distinct subsets of 5-HT receptors in human heart valves, indicating that interstitial cells of the valves potentially respond to serotonin levels.\n",

      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists have potential for the treatment and prevention of disease states such as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, migraine headache, pain, and inflammation. To gain insight into the spatial requirements for CGRP antagonism, three strategies were employed to restrict the conformation of the potent undecapeptide antagonist, [D31,P34,F35]CGRP27-37. First, aza-amino acid scanning was performed, and ten aza-peptide analogues were synthesized and examined for biological activity. Second, (3S,6S,9S)-2-oxo-3-amino-indolizidin-2-one amino acid (I2aa) and (2S,6S,8S)-9-oxo-8-amino-indolizidin-9-one amino acid (I9aa) both were introduced at positions 31-32, 32-33, 33-34, and 34-35, regions of the backbone expected to adopt turns. Finally, the conformation of the backbone and side-chain of the C-terminal residue, Phe35-Ala36-Phe37-NH2, was explored employing (2S,4R,6R,8S)-9-oxo-8-amino-4-phenyl-indolizidin-9-one amino acid (4-Ph-I9aa) as a constrained phenylalanine mimic. The structure-activity relationships exhibited by our 26 analogues illustrate conformational requirements important for designing CGRP antagonists and highlight the importance of beta-turns centered at Gly33-Pro34 for potency.\n",

      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Episodic ataxia type-2 (EA-2) is an autosomal dominant neurological disorder that has been shown to result from mutations in the CACNA1A gene encoding the P/Q-type calcium channel. Affected individuals experience episodes of cerebellar ataxia usually associated with migraine symptoms, interictal nystagmus, mild residual and in some cases a progressive cerebellar incoordination and respond to acetazolamide treatment. We identified a patient with a positive family history for episodic ataxia, who was originally diagnosed with epilepsy and treated with valproic acid. Subsequent examination revealed that the symptoms were consistent with a diagnosis of EA-2. The patient responded positively to a combination of acetazolamide and valproic acid. Molecular genetic analysis of the CACNA1A gene was performed in order to confirm a diagnosis of EA-2. METHODS: The CACNA1A gene was evaluated for mutations using single strand conformational polymorphism analysis and direct DNA sequencing. Allele specific oligo hybridization was used to confirm that the mutation was segregating with only affected family members and was not present in the control group. RESULTS: In this study we identified a new missense mutation in exon 12 of the CACNA1A gene from a patient with EA-2 whose symptoms could be controlled with a combination of acetazolamide and valproic acid. This G to A transition changes a highly conserved glutamic acid residue to a lysine residue in domain II S2 of the P/Q-type calcium channel alpha1A subunit. CONCLUSIONS: The use of valproic acid in treating patients with EA-2 is not well documented. Here we describe a patient with a novel mutation in the CACNA1A gene who responded positively to a combination of acetazolamide and valproic acid.\n",

In our study we aimed to reveal the effect of obesity on meningeal nociceptor function in rats receiving a high-fat, high-sucrose diet. Methods Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) receptor activation-induced changes in meningeal blood flow, release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from trigeminal afferents and TRPA1 protein expression in the trigeminal ganglia were measured in control and obese rats. Metabolic parameters of the animals were assessed by measuring glucose and insulin homeostasis as well as plasma cytokine concentrations. Results The present experiments revealed an enhanced basal and TRPA1 receptor agonist-induced CGRP release from meningeal afferents of obese insulin-resistant rats and an attenuated CGRP release to potassium chloride. Obesity was also associated with an augmented vasodilatation in meningeal arteries after dural application of the TRPA1 agonist acrolein, a reduction in TRPA1 protein expression in the trigeminal ganglia and elevations in circulating proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6 in addition to increased fasting blood glucose and insulin concentrations.

      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Erenumab is a human anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibody developed for migraine prevention. Migraine predominately affects women of childbearing age; thus, it is important to determine potential drug-drug interactions between a common oral contraceptive and drugs used to treat migraine. OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate potential drug-drug interactions between erenumab and a common oral contraceptive. METHODS: Healthy women received three cycles of a norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol-containing oral contraceptive with a single 140-mg subcutaneous dose of erenumab during cycle three. Norgestimate metabolites (norgestrel and norelgestromin) and ethinyl estradiol pharmacokinetics were evaluated in the absence and presence of erenumab. Primary endpoint was peak plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 h (AUC(tau)). Luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and progesterone concentrations were evaluated as pharmacodynamic markers. RESULTS: Erenumab did not influence the pharmacokinetics of norelgestromin, norgestrel, or ethinyl estradiol. Least-squares mean estimates (90% confidence interval) for C(max) ratios were 1.05 (0.90-1.23), 1.06 (0.97-1.16), and 1.04 (0.88-1.22) for norelgestromin, norgestrel, and ethinyl estradiol, respectively. Respective AUC(tau) ratios were 1.02 (0.94-1.12), 1.03 (0.96-1.10), and 1.02 (0.91-1.14). Luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and progesterone concentrations were similar after exposure to oral contraceptive alone and with erenumab. CONCLUSION: Erenumab did not alter the pharmacokinetics of the active components of an estrogen/progestin combination oral contraceptive. Thus, no change in contraceptive efficacy is expected with erenumab. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02792517.\n",

      "PMID:  17290398\n",
      "Abs: The transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) has been shown to be constitutively activated in various human malignancies, including leukemia, lymphoma and a number of solid tumors. NF-kappaB regulates the transcriptional of genes important for tumor invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance. The sesquiterpene lactone parthenolide, an inhibition of NF-kappaB, has been used conventionally to treat migraines and inflammation. In this study, renal cancer cell lines OUR-10 and ACHN were used for in vitro experiments to evaluate growth-inhibitory effects of parthenolide. An OUR-10 xenograft model in nude mice was also used to investigate the in vivo growth-inhibitory effects of parthenolide. Apoptosis in response to treatment of OUR-10 cells with parthenolide was confirmed. Localization of NF-kappaB in response to parthenolide treatment was examined of by immunofluorostaining of OUR-10 cells with antibody against NF-kappaB p65 and by Western blot analysis of OUR-10 cell and tumor nuclear and cytosol fraction. Parthenolide effectively inhibited proliferation of cultured OUR-10 cells and triggered apoptosis in vitro. Subcutaneous injection or oral administration of parthenolide showed significant tumor growth inhibition in the xenograft model via decreased production of interleukin-8 (IL-8) or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis showed decreased nuclear localization of NF-kappaB and phosphorylated NF-kappaB protein and subsequently expression of MMP-9, Bcl-xL and Cox-2 in response to parthenolide treatment. These results indicate that parthenolide is a useful in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and acts via inhibition of NF-kappaB.\n",

      "Abs: Migraine is a common but complex neurological disorder. Its precise mechanisms are not fully understood. Increasing indirect evidence indicates that 5-HT7 receptors may be involved; however, their role remains unknown. Our previous in vivo study showed that selective blockade of 5-HT7 receptors caused decreased serum levels of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the external jugular vein following electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion (TG) in an animal model of migraine. In the present study, we used an in vitro model of cultured TG cells to further investigate whether 5-HT7 receptors are directly responsible for the release of CGRP and substance P from TG neurons. We stimulated rat primary cultured TG neurons with capsaicin or potassium chloride (KCl) to mimic neurogenic inflammation, resulting in release of CGRP and substance P. 5-HT7 receptors were abundantly expressed in TG neurons. Greater than 93 % of 5-HT7 receptor-positive neurons co-expressed CGRP and 56 % co-expressed substance P. Both the capsaicin- and KCl-induced release of CGRP and substance P were unaffected by pretreatment of cultured TG cells with the selective 5-HT7 receptor agonist AS19 and antagonist SB269970. This study demonstrates for the first time that 5-HT7 receptors are abundantly co-expressed with CGRP and substance P in rat primary TG neurons and suggests that they are not responsible for the release of CGRP and substance P from cultured TG neurons evoked by capsaicin or KCl.\n",

      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Fremanezumab (TEV-48125) is a fully humanized anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that has shown positive results in the prevention of episodic migraine and chronic migraine. Previous preclinical studies have revealed CGRP antagonistic effects on intracranial arteries (ICA). The aim of the study was to evaluate the in vitro antagonistic effects of fremanezumab on human arteries. METHODS: Arteries were removed in conjunction with neurosurgery (cerebral, CA, and middle meningeal artery, MMA, n = 7) or reconstructive abdominal surgery (abdominal artery, AA, n = 6). Ring segments of the vessels were mounted in a sensitive myograph, the functional responses of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), substance P and CGRP in increasing concentrations (10(- 10)-10(- 7) M) were studied using pre-contraction with 30 mM potassium chloride (KCl). The concentrations of fremanezumab or isotype control antibody (66.7 nM, 0.33 μM, 0.67 μM) were given 30 min prior to CGRP administration. RESULTS: All included arteries responded with a strong stable contraction to the application of 30 mM KCl. During this pre-contraction, CGRP caused a concentration-dependent relaxation which differed slightly in maximum effect (I(max)) between the types of arteries (ICA = 100%; AA 80%). Fremanezumab (66.7 nM) showed a shift in the IC(50) value of CGRP, but no significant change in I(max). At higher doses there was also a reduction of I(max). For AA, the I(max) decreased from 71% at 66.7 nM, to 4.5% with 0.33 μM of fremanezumab. Isotype control antibody did not modify the responses. There was no effect on concentration-dependent relaxation with VIP with 66.7 nM of fremanezumab or isotype control. CONCLUSION: CGRP relaxes pre-contracted human arteries by 80-100%, but with different IC(50); the potency range was ICA < AA. The antagonistic effect and potency of fremanezumab was similar, suggesting that there are vasodilatory CGRP receptors present in all studied arteries and that the antibody may have effect in all studied vessels.\n",

      "PMID:  16833034\n",
      "Abs: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an inherited autosomal dominant condition characterized by migrane, recurrent stroke, subcortical dementia, and pseudobulbar palsy. It begins with migraine with aura in -33% of patients. CADASIL is commonly overlooked or misdiagnosed owing to its recent identification. The pathological hallmark of angiopathy is the presence of multiple, small, deep cerebral infarcts, leucoencephalopathy, and nonatherorosclerotic, nonamyloid angiopathy involving mainly small, deep perforating cerebral arteries. Changes also are present in vascular smooth muscle cells and consist in the presence of granular osmiophilic material (GOM). The defective gene in CADASIL is Notch 3, which encodes a large transmembrane receptor. Magnetic resonance imaging shows high intensity signal lesions, often confluent, and areas of cystic degeneration of subcortical white matter and basal ganglia. Diagnostic strategies in CADASIL are matter of discussions because the electron microscopic demonstration of GOM was reported in 100% of symptomatic patients of French authors, but only in 45% of a British study. GOMs are not present in presymptomatic patients.\n",

      "Title: Involvement of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and nitric oxide (NO) in the pial artery dilatation elicited by cortical spreading depression\n",
      "PMID:  8180797\n",
      "Abs: The aim of the present study was to examine whether the initial transient arterial dilatation during cortical spreading depression (CSD) was mediated by the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and/or nitric oxide (NO). This question is of interest as the initial phase of CSD appears to be a model of events occurring during functional hyperemia and during the first period of classic migraine. Using an open cranial window technique, pial arterial diameter in the parietal cortex of cats was recorded with an image splitting method. Employing micropuncture technique, perivascularly applied CGRP8-37 did not alter the resting diameter of pial arteries but antagonized concentration dependently (5 x 10(-9)-10(-6) M) the dilatation (35%) due to 5 x 10(-8) M CGRP. NG-Nitro-L-Arginine (NOLAG, 10(-4) M) also had no effect on resting diameter of pial arteries, indicating that their resting tone is neither mediated by a continuous release of CGRP nor of NO. CSD was triggered by a remote intracortical injection of KCl (150 mM) and recorded by a microelectrode placed adjacent to the artery under investigation. CSD elicited a transient negative DC shift which was accompanied by a peak dilatation of 44 +/- 5.2% (S.E.M.). This dilatation was reduced by approximately 50% during topical application of 10(-7) M CGRP8-37 and 10(-4) M NOLAG each. A 75% inhibition of the CSD-induced dilatation was found during simultaneous application of both compounds. These data indicate that the initial dilatation during CSD is mediated, at least in part, by a release of CGRP and NO.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "Title: Hemokinin-1 Gene Expression Is Upregulated in Trigeminal Ganglia in an Inflammatory Orofacial Pain Model: Potential Role in Peripheral Sensitization\n",
      "PMID:  32331300\n",
      "Abs: A large percentage of primary sensory neurons in the trigeminal ganglia (TG) contain neuropeptides such as tachykinins or calcitonin gene-related peptide. Neuropeptides released from the central terminals of primary afferents sensitize the secondary nociceptive neurons in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC), but also activate glial cells contributing to neuroinflammation and consequent sensitization in chronic orofacial pain and migraine. In the present study, we investigated the newest member of the tachykinin family, hemokinin-1 (HK-1) encoded by the Tac4 gene in the trigeminal system. HK-1 had been shown to participate in inflammation and hyperalgesia in various models, but its role has not been investigated in orofacial pain or headache. In the complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced inflammatory orofacial pain model, we showed that Tac4 expression increased in the TG in response to inflammation. Duration-dependent Tac4 upregulation was associated with the extent of the facial allodynia. Tac4 was detected in both TG neurons and satellite glial cells (SGC) by the ultrasensitive RNAscope in situ hybridization. We also compared gene expression changes of selected neuronal and glial sensitization and neuroinflammation markers between wild-type and Tac4-deficient (Tac4(-/-)) mice. Expression of the SGC/astrocyte marker in the TG and TNC was significantly lower in intact and saline/CFA-treated Tac4(-/-) mice. The procedural stress-related increase of the SGC/astrocyte marker was also strongly attenuated in Tac4(-/)(-) mice. Analysis of TG samples with a mouse neuroinflammation panel of 770 genes revealed that regulation of microglia and cytotoxic cell-related genes were significantly different in saline-treated Tac4(-/-) mice compared to their wild-types. It is concluded that HK-1 may participate in neuron-glia interactions both under physiological and inflammatory conditions and mediate pain in the trigeminal system.\n",

      "Title: BIBN4096BS and CGRP(8-37) antagonize the relaxant effects of alpha-CGRP more than those of beta-CGRP in human extracranial arteries\n",
      "PMID:  15983761\n",
      "Abs: We hypothesize that dilatation of extracranial arteries during migraine could be caused by CGRP. We compared the relaxant effects of alpha-calcitonin gene-related peptide (alpha-CGRP) and beta-calcitonin gene-related peptide (beta-CGRP) and the antagonism by BIBN4096BS and CGRP(8-37) on rings of human temporal and occipital arteries precontracted with KCl. beta-CGRP relaxed temporal (-logEC50M = 8.1) and occipital arteries (-logEC50M = 7.6) with 19-fold and 29-fold lower potencies respectively than alpha-CGRP. Nearly maximal effective concentrations of alpha-CGRP (4 nM) and beta-CGRP (50 nM) caused stable relaxations of the temporal artery for 4 h without fading. BIBN4094BS antagonized the effects of alpha-CGRP (pK(B) = 10.1 and 9.9, respectively) more than beta-CGRP (pK(B) = 9.3 and 9.2 respectively) on both temporal and occipital arteries. CGRP(8-37) antagonized the effects of alpha-CGRP (pK(B) = 6.6 and 6.4 respectively) more than beta-CGRP (pK(B) = 5.7 and 5.5 respectively) on both temporal and occipital arteries. Antagonism of the relaxant effects of alpha-CGRP (4 nM) and beta-CGRP (50 nM) by BIBN4096BS (10 and 100 nM) was reversible for beta-CGRP, but irreversible for alpha-CGRP, 1 h after BIBN4096BS washout. We conclude that alpha-CGRP and beta-CGRP interact either at different binding sites of the same CGRP receptor system or all together with different receptor systems in human extracranial arteries. BIBN4096BS binds more firmly to the receptor activated by alpha-CGRP than to the receptor activated by beta-CGRP.\n",

      "PMID:  32992168\n",
      "Abs: Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are pathologic low-resistance conduits between a pulmonary artery and vein. Over 80% PAVMs occur in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and result from mutations in the transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway. Mutations in the Growth Differentiation Factor 2 (GDF2) gene have recently been described to result in a vascular-anomaly syndrome with phenotypic overlap with HHT. We report a 43-year-old woman with a PAVM related ischemic stroke who was subsequently found to have a novel GDF2 gene mutation. The patient underwent coil-embolization of the PAVM with stable clinical and radiographic follow-up. It is important to diagnose PAVMs as they are an important cause of stroke-in-young; and can be treated definitively, reducing risk of recurrent stroke and migraine.CI - Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

      "PMID:  28303458\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is widely distributed in nociceptive pathways in human peripheral and central nervous system and its receptors are also expressed in pain pathways. CGRP is involved in migraine pathophysiology but its role in non-headache pain has not been clarified. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search on PubMed, Embase and ClinicalTrials.gov for articles on CGRP and non-headache pain covering human studies including experimental studies and randomized clinical trials. RESULTS: The literature search identified 375 citations of which 50 contained relevant original data. An association between measured CGRP levels and somatic, visceral, neuropathic and inflammatory pain was found. In 13 out of 20 studies in somatic pain conditions, CGRP levels had a positive correlation with pain. Increased CGRP levels were reported in plasma, synovial and cerebrospinal fluid in subjects with musculoskeletal pain. A randomized clinical trial on monoclonal antibody, which selectively binds to and inhibits the activity of CGRP (galcanezumab) in patients with osteoarthritis knee pain, failed to demonstrate improvement of pain compared with placebo. No studies to date have investigated the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies against CGRP receptor in non-headache pain conditions. CONCLUSION: The present review revealed the association between measured CGRP levels and somatic, visceral, neuropathic and inflammatory pain. These data suggest that CGRP may act as a neuromodulator in non-headache pain conditions. However, more studies are needed to fully understand the role of CGRP in nociceptive processing and therapy of chronic pain.\n",

      "PMID:  25344745\n",
      "Abs: The objective of the study is to detail clinical and NOTCH3 gene mutational spectrum in a large group of Italian CADASIL patients. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a familial cerebral small vessels disease caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene on 19p13 usually presenting in young or middle adulthood. Characteristic features include migraine, recurrent lacunar stroke, subcortical dementia, mood disturbances and leukoencephalopathy. The disorder is often overlooked and misdiagnosed. CADASIL prevalence and disease burden is still undetermined. We retrospectively reviewed demographic, clinical, and mutational characteristic of all CADASIL patients diagnosed from January 2002 to December 2012 in three referral centers for neurogenetic and cerebrovascular diseases in central Italy. 229 NOTCH3 positive subjects were identified. Mean age at diagnosis was 57.8 ± 14.7 years, and 48.6 ± 17.1 years at first symptom onset. Most frequent clinical symptoms were ischemic events (59 %) and psychiatric disturbances (48 %). The highest percentage of mutations were found on exons 4 and 19 (20.6 and 17.6 % respectively), the remaining being dispersed over the entire EGF-like region of the NOTCH3 gene. 209 patients resided in a circumscribed geographic area which included three regions of the central Italy, yielding a minimum prevalence of 4.1 per 100.000 adult inhabitants. This is the most extensive study on CADASIL in Italy. Clinical phenotype showed several peculiarities in frequency and presentation of the main disease manifestations. Our study enlarges the number of pathogenic NOTCH3 mutations and due to the heterogeneous mutational spectrum observed suggests that full sequencing of exons 2-24 is mandatory for CADASIL screening in the Italian population.\n",

      "Title: The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) prevents inflammatory liver injury in mice\n",
      "PMID:  19464067\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND/AIMS: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a potent vasodilator and supposed to be responsible for neurogenic inflammation involved in migraine. Its role in inflammatory diseases of other organs is controversial and poorly investigated regarding liver inflammation, although the organ is innervated by CGRP containing primary sensory nerve fibers. METHODS: Male Balb/c and IL-10(-/-) mice were pretreated with either alphaCGRP or the CGRP receptor antagonists CGRP(8-37) or BIBN4096BS. Immune-mediated liver injury was induced by administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) to galactosamine (GalN)-sensitized mice and evaluated by serum transaminase activities and cytokine levels. Furthermore, intrahepatic CGRP receptor expression and hepatic CGRP concentrations were examined. RESULTS: CGRP receptor 1 was expressed by immune cells and hepatocytes in human and murine liver. During liver injury CGRP receptor expression was increased whereas hepatic CGRP concentrations concomitantly decreased. While CGRP receptor antagonists failed to affect liver damage, pretreatment with alphaCGRP protected mice from GalN/LPS-induced liver injury by suppression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine response independently from IL-10 but related to the induction of the transcriptional repressor inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER). In contrast, alphaCGRP failed to protect against GalN/TNFalpha-induced liver failure. CONCLUSION: In the liver, CGRP exerts anti-inflammatory properties, which are characterized by a reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.\n",

      "Title: Involvement of nitric oxide in the modulation of dural arterial blood flow in the rat\n",
      "PMID:  10742295\n",
      "Abs: 1. Nitric oxide (NO) has been proposed to be a key molecule in the pathogenesis of migraine pain and other headaches that are linked to vascular disorders. Several lines of evidence indicate that the meningeal vascularization is crucially involved in the generation of these headaches. In an experimental model in the rat a dominating role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in causing neurogenic vasodilatation and increased blood flow has been shown. The aim of the present study was to clarify the role of NO in this model with regard to the meningeal blood flow. 2. The blood flow in and around the medial meningeal artery (dural arterial flow) was recorded in the exposed parietal dura mater encephali of barbiturate anaesthetized rats using laser Doppler flowmetry. Local electrical stimulation of the dura mater (pulses of 0.5 ms delivered at 7.5 - 17.5 V and 5 or 10 Hz for 30 s) caused temporary increases in dural arterial flow for about 1 min that reached peaks of 1.6 - 2.6 times the basal flow. The effects of NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors on the basal flow and the electrically evoked increases in flow were examined. 3. Systemic (i. v.) administration of N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) at cumulative doses of 10 and 50 mg kg(-1) lowered the basal flow to 87 and 72%, respectively, of the control and reduced the evoked increases in blood flow to 82 and 44% on an average. Both these effects could partly be reversed by 300 mg kg(-1) L-arginine. The systemic arterial pressure was increased by L-NAME at both doses. Injection of the stereoisomer D-NAME at same doses did not change basal flow and evoked increases in flow. 4. 4. Topical application of L-NAME (10(-4) - 10(-2) M) was effective only at the highest concentration, which caused lowering of the basal blood flow to 78% of the control; the evoked increases in flow were not changed. Topical application of 2-amino-5,6-dihydro-6-methyl-4H-1,3-thiazine (AMT), a specific inhibitor of the inducible NOS, at concentrations of 10(-4) - 10(-2) M lowered the basal flow to 89, 87.5 and 85%, respectively, but did not significantly change the evoked flow increases. Same concentrations of 7-nitroindazole monosodium salt (7-NINA), a specific inhibitor of the neuronal NOS, had no significant effects on basal flow and evoked increases in flow. 5. It is concluded that NO is involved in the maintenance of the basal level of dural arterial blood flow as well as in the electrically evoked flow increases, which have been shown to be mainly mediated by CGRP released from dural afferent fibres. The most important source of NO is probably the endothelium of dural arterial vessels. The synergistic effect of NO and CGRP on the stimulated blood flow may be in part due to a NO mediated facilitation of the CGRP release.\n",

      "PMID:  30545719\n",
      "Abs: Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a genetically determined disease of the cerebral vessels, characterized by recurrent ischemic strokes, dementia, and degeneration of the cerebral white matter. The condition is caused by a mutation in the NOTCH3 gene, whose product plays a great role in the development and physiology of the cardiovascular system. Magnetic resonance imaging reveals multiple hyperintensive lesions of the white matter in the T2-weighted images also in asymptomatic carriers of CADASIL and can be detected even 10-15 years prior to clinical signs. Diagnosis is confirmed by genetic testing. We present 2 patients (mother and daughter) carrying the same mutation p.Cys212Gly in 1 allele of the NOTCH-3 gene, which has not yet been recorded in the Human Gene Mutation Database for that gene and therefore described as a new one. The clinical manifestation of the disease differs between patients -the 63-year-old mother has been suffering from severe migraine headaches since her early youth and the first vascular event occurred when she was about 50 years old, she is now presenting with impaired cognitive functions, left facial palsy, bilateral pyramidal syndrome more prominent on the left side, and four-wheel support assisted walking. The neurological deficits that her 42-year-old daughter is afflicted with are discreet. Observation to date indicates a definitely less severe clinical course of the disease. This indicates that members of the same family carrying the same mutation may produce different clinical course of the disease.CI - Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc.\n",

      "Title: Astrocyte elevated gene-1 induces autophagy in diabetic cardiomyopathy through upregulation of KLF4\n",
      "PMID:  30520133\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1), also known as metadherin, 3D3, and lysine-rich carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) coisolated, has emerged as an important oncogene that is overexpressed in a variety of cancers. Previous studies revealed that AEG-1 is also involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes, such as development, inflammation, neurodegeneration, migraine, and Huntington's disease. However, the function of AEG-1 in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) has not been reported yet. Therefore, we conducted this study to characterize the potential role and mechanism of AEG-1 in DCM rats. METHODS: DCM was induced by injections of streptozocin (STZ) in Wistar rats. Rats were randomized to be injected with lentivirus carrying AEG-1 small interfering RNA. Haemodynamic changes of Wistar rats, assessment of cardiac weight index, and the expression of AEG-1 and KLF4 were detected and compared among these three groups. RESULTS: The expressions of AEG-1 and KLF4 in the STZ group were significantly elevated in cardiac tissues compared with the control group. Knockdown of AEG-1 significantly increased the values of left ventricular ejection fraction, ±dp/dt (max) , repressed autophagy, as well as upregulated the expression of KLF4. CONCLUSIONS: Knockdown of AEG-1 suppresses autophagy in DCM by downregulating the expression of KLF4. This study provide first-notion evidence for the potential value of AEG-1 as a therapeutic target for the treatment of the patients with DCM.CI - © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",

It was also the year of population-based studies from huge public or private registers. Thus, epidemiologic correlations have been put forward: psoriasis and vascular risk, psoriasis and rhinosinusitis, rosacea and migraine, acne and food habits, eczema and basal-cell carcinoma, vitiligo and lower risk of skin cancer, cutaneous Ro/SS-A pos lupus and cancer, chronic eczema and calcium-channel inhlbitors, pemphigoid and loop diuretics. Risk of IBD induced by isotretinoin has not been confirmed but risk of skin cancer under azathioprine is real. New drug reactions have appeared (pigmentation due to interferon, hypodermitis and sarcoidosis to anti-BRAF, vandetanib) and old ones are revisited (patch-testing of Severe Cutaneous adverse cutaneous reactions, pigmentation due to anti-malarial drugs, neutrophilic dermatosis due to azathioprine).

      "PMID:  29032483\n",
      "Abs: In the heart, voltage-gated sodium (Na(v)) channel (Na(v)1.5) is defined by its pore-forming α-subunit and its auxiliary β-subunits, both of which are important for its critical contribution to the initiation and maintenance of the cardiac action potential (AP) that underlie normal heart rhythm. The physiological relevance of Na(v)1.5 is further marked by the fact that inherited or congenital mutations in Na(v)1.5 channel gene SCN5A lead to altered functional expression (including expression, trafficking, and current density), and are generally manifested in the form of distinct cardiac arrhythmic events, epilepsy, neuropathic pain, migraine, and neuromuscular disorders. However, despite significant advances in defining the pathophysiology of Na(v)1.5, the molecular mechanisms that underlie its regulation and contribution to cardiac disorders are poorly understood. It is rapidly becoming evident that the functional expression (localization, trafficking and gating) of Na(v)1.5 may be under modulation by post-translational modifications that are associated with phosphorylation. We review here the molecular basis of cardiac Na channel regulation by kinases (PKA and PKC) and the resulting functional consequences. Specifically, we discuss: (1) recent literature on the structural, molecular, and functional properties of cardiac Na(v)1.5 channels; (2) how these properties may be altered by phosphorylation in disease states underlain by congenital mutations in Na(v)1.5 channel and/or subunits such as long QT and Brugada syndromes. Our expectation is that understanding the roles of these distinct and complex phosphorylation processes on the functional expression of Na(v)1.5 is likely to provide crucial mechanistic insights into Na channel associated arrhythmogenic events and will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies.\n",

      "Abs: By the introduction of technological advancement in methods of structural analysis, electronics, and recombinant DNA techniques, research in physiology has become molecular. Additionally, focus of interest has been moving away from classical physiology to become increasingly centered on mechanisms of disease. A wonderful example for this development, as evident by this review, is the field of ion channel research which would not be nearly as advanced had it not been for human diseases to clarify. It is for this reason that structure-function relationships and ion channel electrophysiology cannot be separated from the genetic and clinical description of ion channelopathies. Unique among reviews of this topic is that all known human hereditary diseases of voltage-gated ion channels are described covering various fields of medicine such as neurology (nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, benign neonatal convulsions, episodic ataxia, hemiplegic migraine, deafness, stationary night blindness), nephrology (X-linked recessive nephrolithiasis, Bartter), myology (hypokalemic and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, myotonia congenita, paramyotonia, malignant hyperthermia), cardiology (LQT syndrome), and interesting parallels in mechanisms of disease emphasized. Likewise, all types of voltage-gated ion channels for cations (sodium, calcium, and potassium channels) and anions (chloride channels) are described together with all knowledge about pharmacology, structure, expression, isoforms, and encoding genes.\n",

      "PMID:  28603014\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a 37 amino acid neuropeptide with several functions including vasodilation, the perception of painful stimuli, and inflammation. The CGRP receptor consists of two main components; calcitonin-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1). While there is a growing recognition that CGRP plays a key role in migraine, the function of CGRP in the retina has not been fully established. This study aims to investigate the distribution of CGRP and its two receptor components in the rat retina, visually by immunohistochemistry and quantitatively using flow cytometry. CGRP immunoreactivity was found in the Müller cells while CLR/RAMP1 was located in the nerve fiber layer. Furthermore, since almost all RAMP1 immunoreactive cells co-express CLR, we propose that RAMP1 expression in the retina reflects functional CGRP receptors.CI - Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

      "PMID:  22246026\n",
      "Abs: To test the hypothesis that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) modulates brain activity, we investigated the effect of intravenous CGRP on brain activity in response to a visual stimulus. In addition, we examined if possible alteration in brain activity was reversed by the anti-migraine drug sumatriptan. Eighteen healthy volunteers were randomly allocated to receive CGRP infusion (1.5 μg/min for 20 min) or placebo. In vivo activity in the visual cortex was recorded before, during and after infusion and after 6 mg subcutaneous sumatriptan by functional magnetic resonance imaging (3 T). 77% of the participants reported headache after CGRP. We found no changes in brain activity after CGRP (P = 0.12) or after placebo (P = 0.41). Sumatriptan did not affect brain activity after CGRP (P = 0.71) or after placebo (P = 0.98). Systemic CGRP or sumatriptan has no direct effects on the BOLD activity in visual cortex. This suggests that in healthy volunteers both CGRP and sumatriptan may exert their actions outside of the blood-brain barrier.CI - © The Author(s) 2012.

      "Title: Yield of screening for CADASIL mutations in lacunar stroke and leukoaraiosis\n",
      "PMID:  12511775\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a monogenic disorder typified by early onset lacunar strokes, subcortical dementia, psychiatric disturbances, and migraine. Mutations in the Notch3 gene are responsible. Atypical phenotypes have been recognized, and the disease is probably underdiagnosed in the wider stroke population. Therefore, we determined the yield of screening for Notch3 mutations in lacunar stroke with or without leukoaraiosis. METHODS: Two hundred eighteen consecutive patients were studied. All had brain and carotid imaging. Polymerase chain reaction-single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis was used to screen exons 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the Notch3 gene for mutations and polymorphisms. RESULTS: A single mutation in exon 4 (C697T) was identified in a young patient, giving an overall carrier frequency of 0.05% (95% CI, 0.0 to 2.0). For patients with onset of lacunar stroke at < or =65 years and leukoaraiosis, the yield was 2.0% (95% CI, 0.4 to 10.9). CONCLUSIONS: Notch3 mutations are rare in patients with typical strokes due to cerebral small-vessel disease. In the absence of classic features suggestive of CADASIL, screening for Notch3 mutations has a low yield.\n",

      "PMID:  11458185\n",
      "Abs: Atypical phenotypes of CADASIL and corresponding anatomical data in two cases are described in 6 members of 2 new French families. In the first family, 4 cases in the same kindred were probably affected, two of them with a predominant psychiatric presentation, two others with dementia and a pseudo-bulbar syndrome of progressive evolution. No history of migraine or ischemic event were documented in any. In the propositus, the diagnosis was documented by skin biopsy, Notch 3 gene mutation and autopsy after the patient had died when 67 years old, 8 years after onset. Brain examination showed a widespread leukoencephalopathy with subcortical infarcts. Characteristic granular lesions of the small arteries of the brain and other organs were observed. In the second family, two cases are reported. One patient died when 63 years old after a subacute evolution mimicking intracranial hypertension. The anatomical diagnosis was retrospectively proven typical of CADASIL with Notch 3 immunostaining of arterial smooth muscle cells. The other case had a progressive evolution over 20 years of limb paresthesia with a mild spasticity diagnosed as a progressive form of multiple sclerosis. It was followed by a pseudo-bulbar syndrome and a mild subcortical dementia without acute ischemic attack. The diagnosis was confirmed by skin biopsy and mutation of the Notch 3 gene.

      "Title: Effect of Infusion of Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide on Cluster Headache Attacks: A Randomized Clinical Trial\n",
      "PMID:  29987329\n",
      "Abs: IMPORTANCE: Signaling molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) induces migraine attacks and anti-CGRP medications abort and prevent migraine attacks. Whether CGRP provokes cluster headache attacks is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether CGRP induces cluster headache attacks in episodic cluster headache in active phase, episodic cluster headache in remission phase, and chronic cluster headache. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover study set at the Danish Headache Center, Rigshospitalet Glostrup, in Denmark. Analyses were intent to treat. Inclusion took place from December 2015 to April 2017. Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of episodic/chronic cluster headache, patients aged 18 to 65 years, and safe contraception in women. Exclusion criteria were a history of other primary headache (except episodic tension-type headache <5 days/mo), individuals who were pregnant or nursing; cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or psychiatric disease; and drug misuse. INTERVENTIONS: Thirty-seven patients with cluster headaches received intravenous infusion of 1.5 μg/min of CGRP or placebo over 20 minutes on 2 study days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Difference in incidence of cluster headache-like attacks, difference in area under the curve (AUC) for headache intensity scores (0 to 90 minutes), and difference in time to peak headache between CGRP and placebo in the 3 groups. RESULTS: Of 91 patients assessed for eligibility, 32 patients (35.2%) were included in the analysis. The mean (SD) age was 36 (10.7) years (range, 19-60 years), and the mean weight was 78 kg (range, 53-100 kg). Twenty-seven men (84.4%) completed the study. Calcitonin gene-related peptide induced cluster headache attacks in 8 of 9 patients in the active phase (mean, 89%; 95% CI, 63-100) compared with 1 of 9 in the placebo group (mean, 11%; 95% CI, 0-37) (P = .05). In the remission phase, no patients with episodic cluster headaches reported attacks after CGRP or placebo. Calcitonin gene-related peptide-induced attacks occurred in 7 of 14 patients with chronic cluster headaches (mean, 50%; 95% CI, 20-80) compared with none after placebo (P = .02). In patients with episodic active phase, the mean AUC from 0 to 90 minutes for CGRP was 1.903 (95% CI, 0.842-2.965), and the mean AUC from 0 to 90 minutes for the placebo group was 0.343 (95% CI, 0-0.867) (P = .04). In patients with chronic cluster headache, the mean AUC from 0 to 90 minutes for CGRP was 1.214 (95% CI, 0.395-2.033), and the mean AUC from 0 to 90 minutes for the placebo group was 0.036 (95% CI, 0-0.114) (P = .01). In the remission phase, the mean AUC from 0 to 90 minutes for CGRP was 0.187 (95% CI, 0-0.571), and the mean AUC from 0 to 90 minutes for placebo was 0.019 (95% CI, 0-0.062) (P > .99). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Calcitonin gene-related peptide provokes cluster headache attacks in active-phase episodic cluster headache and chronic cluster headache but not in remission-phase episodic cluster headache. These results suggest anti-CGRP drugs may be effective in cluster headache management. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02466334).\n",

      "Title: Missense CACNA1A mutation causing episodic ataxia type 2\n",
      "PMID:  11176968\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVES: To characterize the nature of CACNA1A mutation in a previously unreported family with episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2) and to better delineate EA2 clinical features. BACKGROUND: Episodic ataxia type 2 is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the recurrence of acetazolamide-responsive spells of cerebellar ataxia, usually starting during childhood or adolescence. The mutated gene, CACNA1A, is located on chromosome 19 and encodes the alpha1A subunit voltage-dependent calcium channel. So far, most CACNA1A mutations detected in patients with EA2 have led to a truncated CACNA1A protein, whereas missense mutations cause familial hemiplegic migraine. METHODS: All 47 exons of CACNA1A were screened by a combination of single-strand conformer polymorphism and sequencing analysis. RESULTS: A CACNA1A missense mutation, Glu 1757 Lys, was identified. It was absent in 200 control chromosomes. It is predicted to result in an amino acid substitution at a highly phylogenetically conserved position, within a domain that plays a major role in the function of the channel. CONCLUSIONS: The Glu 1757 Lys missense mutation is likely to be pathogenic, causing episodic ataxia within a family whose phenotype is indistinguishable from EA2 except for a slightly later age of onset. These data strongly suggest that additional work is needed to fully establish genotype/phenotype correlations for CACNA1A mutations.\n",

      "PMID:  12101511\n",
      "Abs: Neurogenic inflammation is elicited by activation of unmyelinated sensory neurons through noxious stimuli and subsequent release of neuropeptides such as substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from peripheral nerve endings. The nerve-mediated inflammatory responses in the tissue consist of hyperaemia and oedema which under some circumstances may be accompanied by pain. Neurogenic inflammation has been implicated in the pathophysiology of various human diseases with uncertain etiology. Signs of inflammation and hyperalgesia associated with chronic pain syndromes such as migraine, arthritis and complex regional pain syndrome resemble the characteristics of neurogenic inflammation. By extrapolation of convincing evidence obtained in rodent models, neurogenic inflammation is assumed to contribute to diseases of the respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, urogenital tract, and skin in humans. Since, however, highly selective substance P receptor antagonists, found to be effective against inflammation in rodents, failed to inhibit inflammatory processes in clinical trials, the hypothesis of an involvement of neurogenic inflammation in human diseases is discussed critically in this review. Beyond its primarily inflammatory character neurogenic inflammation can be regarded as a mechanism that activates protective responses, thus bringing about a first line of defence to maintain the integrity of the tissue and to contribute to tissue repair.\n",

      "Abs: Channels involved in the influx and intracellular mobilization of calcium have been implicated as targets of diverse genetic and immune-mediated neurological diseases. These include the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel of skeletal muscle (hypokalemic periodic paralysis), the neuronal P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel (familial hemiplegic migraine, episodic ataxia type 2, spinocerebellar ataxia 6, and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome), and the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (malignant hyperthermia and central core disease). The discovery of these and other calcium channelopathies should help to clarify how different mutations affect channel function and how altered channel function produces disease, and may lead to new treatments for these conditions.\n",

      "Abs: The point mutation Arg506- > Gln of factor V was recently shown to be an important and relatively common genetic cause of venous thromboembolism. Using a DNA technique based on polymerase chain reaction, we surveyed the blood samples of 236 patients with ischaemic stroke or a transient ischaemic attack, 122 survivors of myocardial infarction and 137 control subjects for the presence of this mutation. Although the frequency of the factor V mutation in patients with arterial disease (4.5%) was not significantly different from that in healthy blood donors (2.9%), a carrier status for this mutant gene was associated with symptoms of migraine and relatively mild angiographic abnormalities among patients with cerebrovascular disease. A more extensive study addressing the occurrence and significance of the mutant factor V mutation in patients with vasospastic cerebrovascular diseases seems to be warranted.\n",

      "PMID:  18720749\n",
      "Abs: INTRODUCTION: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a hereditary microangiopathy leading to recurrent strokes and vascular dementia in young and middle-aged patients. The diagnosis of CADASIL is based on typical clinical presentation and characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes, and has to be confirmed by biopsy of the sural nerve, muscle and skin, as well as by genetic analysis. Mutations within the Notch3 gene were identified as the underlying genetic defect in CADASIL. CASE OUTLINE: The clinical manifestations of the first presented patient with migraine from the age of thirteen, stroke without vascular risk factors and stepwise progression of vascular dementia comprising the typical clinical picture of CADASIL, were confirmed after seven years with pathological verification. The second presented case did not satisfy the clinical criteria for CADASIL. His stroke was considered to be related with vascular risk factors--diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The aetiological diagnosis was established only when his brother without vascular risk factors presented with similar clinical manifestations. CONCLUSION: Until the development of the new neuroimaging techniques like MRI, pathologic and genetic analysis, CADASIL was considered as a rare disorder. However, the increasing number of CADASIL families has been identified throughout the world showing that this entity is usually underdiagnosed. This article presents three patients from two Serbian families with clinical suspicion of CADASIL verified by pathologic examination.\n",

      "PMID:  24126255\n",
      "Abs: Congenital malformations are a prevalent cause of infant mortality in the United States and their induction has been linked to a variety of factors, including exposure to teratogens. However, the molecular mechanisms of teratogenicity are not fully understood. MicroRNAs are an important group of small, non-coding RNAs that regulate mRNA expression. MicroRNA roles in early embryonic development are well established, and their disruption during development can cause abnormalities. We hypothesized that developmental exposure to teratogens such as valproic acid alters microRNA expression profiles in developing embryos. Valproic acid is an anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing drug used to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder and migraines. To examine the effects of valproic acid on microRNA expression during development, we used zebrafish embryos as a model vertebrate developmental system. Zebrafish embryos were continuously exposed to valproic acid (1mM) or vehicle control (ethanol) starting from 4h post-fertilization (hpf) and sampled at 48 and 96hpf to determine the miRNA expression profiles prior to and after the onset of developmental defects. At 96hpf, 95% of the larvae showed skeletal deformities, abnormal swimming behavior, and pericardial effusion. Microarray expression profiling was done using Agilent zebrafish miRNA microarrays. Microarray results revealed changes in miRNA expression at both time points. Thirteen miRNAs were differentially expressed at 48hpf and 22 miRNAs were altered at 96hpf. Among them, six miRNAs (miR-16a, 18c, 122, 132, 457b, and 724) were common to both time points. Bioinformatic target prediction and examination of published literature revealed that these miRNAs target several genes involved in the normal functioning of the central nervous system. These results suggest that the teratogenic effects of valproic acid could involve altered miRNA expression.CI - © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n",

      "PMID:  32366601\n",
      "Abs: ALD403 is a genetically engineered, humanized immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of human calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Clinical trial data indicate that ALD403 is effective as a preventive therapy for migraine and has an acceptable safety profile. For preclinical characterization of ALD403, rabbit antibodies targeting α-CGRP were humanized and modified to eliminate fragment crystallizable (Fc) γ receptor (FcγR) and complement interactions. The ability of ALD403 to inhibit CGRP-induced cAMP production was assessed using a cAMP bioassay (Meso Scale Discovery). The IC(50) for inhibition of cAMP release was 434 and 288 pM with the rabbit-human chimera antibody and the humanized ALD403, respectively. ALD403 inhibited α-CGRP binding with an IC(50) of 4.7 × 10(-11) and 1.2 × 10(-10) M for the α-CGRP and AMY1 receptors, respectively. ALD403 did not induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or complement-dependent cytotoxicity and did not stably interact with any of the FcγR mediating these functions, exhibiting only weak binding to FcγRI. ALD403 significantly lowered capsaicin-induced blood flow responses in rodents at all time points starting at 5 minutes postapplication in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, ALD403 is a potent functional ligand inhibitor of α-CGRP‒driven pharmacology. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: α-Calcitonin gene-related peptide blockade by ALD403 was assessed via radiolabeled ligand displacement, in vitro inhibition of cell signaling, and in vivo inhibition of capsaicin-induced vasodilation. Lack of engagement of fragment crystallizable-mediated immune-effector functions by ALD403 was shown.CI - Copyright © 2020 by The Author(s).\n",

      "PMID:  15910566\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and related peptides may be involved in migraine pathogenesis. To understand their vasomotor role in the cerebral circulation, we performed two studies, a pressurized arteriography study of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and a genuine closed cranial window (gCCW) in vivo study. Using the pressurized arteriography model rat MCAs were mounted on micropipettes, pressurized to 85 mmHg and luminally perfused. The diameter responses to luminally and abluminally applied rat-alphaCGRP, rat-betaCGRP, amylin and adrenomedullin were compared with the resting diameter. Only abluminally applied CGRP induced dilation of the cerebral arteries; E(max) for alphaCGRP and betaCGRP were 35 +/- 0.5% and 10.8 +/- 0.2%. These responses were blocked by CGRP(8-37). The gCCW model allowed videomicroscopic visualization of the pial vessels in anaesthetized rats. Changes in vessel diameter to intravenously administered alphaCGRP and betaCGRP were compared with pre-infusion baseline. Intravenous infusion of alphaCGRP and betaCGRP in the highest dose induced dilation of the cerebral cortical pial arteries/arterioles of 40.3 +/- 7.5% and 49.1 +/- 8.4%, respectively. However, this was probably secondary to a decrease in blood pressure of 44.8 +/- 3.3 mmHg and 49.2 +/- 3.3 mmHg. Our results suggest that CGRP receptors are probably functional on the smooth muscle cells and not on the endothelium of rat cerebral arteries.\n",

      "PMID:  29723195\n",
      "Abs: Ambient temperature is a critical environmental factor for all living organisms. It was likely an important selective force as modern humans recently colonized temperate and cold Eurasian environments. Nevertheless, as of yet we have limited evidence of local adaptation to ambient temperature in populations from those environments. To shed light on this question, we exploit the fact that humans are a cosmopolitan species that inhabit territories under a wide range of temperatures. Focusing on cold perception-which is central to thermoregulation and survival in cold environments-we show evidence of recent local adaptation on TRPM8. This gene encodes for a cation channel that is, to date, the only temperature receptor known to mediate an endogenous response to moderate cold. The upstream variant rs10166942 shows extreme population differentiation, with frequencies that range from 5% in Nigeria to 88% in Finland (placing this SNP in the 0.02% tail of the FST empirical distribution). When all populations are jointly analyzed, allele frequencies correlate with latitude and temperature beyond what can be explained by shared ancestry and population substructure. Using a Bayesian approach, we infer that the allele originated and evolved neutrally in Africa, while positive selection raised its frequency to different degrees in Eurasian populations, resulting in allele frequencies that follow a latitudinal cline. We infer strong positive selection, in agreement with ancient DNA showing high frequency of the allele in Europe 3,000 to 8,000 years ago. rs10166942 is important phenotypically because its ancestral allele is protective of migraine. This debilitating disorder varies in prevalence across human populations, with highest prevalence in individuals of European descent-precisely the population with the highest frequency of rs10166942 derived allele. We thus hypothesize that local adaptation on previously neutral standing variation may have contributed to the genetic differences that exist in the prevalence of migraine among human populations today.\n",

      "PMID:  15667412\n",
      "Abs: Complex forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) are rare and usually transmitted in an autosomal recessive pattern. A family of four generations with autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia (AD-HSP) and a complex phenotype with variably expressed co-existing ataxia, dysarthria, unipolar depression, epilepsy, migraine, and cognitive impairment was investigated. Genetic linkage analysis and sequencing of the SPG4 gene was performed and electrophysiologic investigations were carried out in six individuals and positron emission tomography (PET) in one patient. The disease was linked to the SPG4 locus on chromosome 2p as previously reported for pure HSP. Sequence analysis of the SPG4 (spastin) gene identified a novel 1593 C > T (GLN490Stop) mutation leading to premature termination of exon 12 with ensuing truncation of the encoded protein. However, the mutation was only identified in those individuals who were clinically affected by a complex phenotype consisting of HSP and cerebellar ataxia. Other features noted in this kindred including epilepsy, cognitive impairment, depression, and migraine did not segregate with the HSP phenotype or mutation, and therefore the significance of these features to SPG4 is unclear. Electrophysiologic investigation showed increased central conduction time at somatosensory evoked potentials measured from the lower limbs as the only abnormal finding in two affected individuals with the SPG4 mutation. Moreover, PET of one patient showed significantly relatively decreased regional cerebral blood flow in most of the cerebellum. We conclude that this kindred demonstrates a considerable overlap between cerebellar ataxia and spastic paraplegia, emphasizing the marked clinical heterogeneity of HSP associated with spastin mutations.\n",

      "PMID:  17220751\n",
      "Abs: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic disorder characterized by epistaxis, telangiectasia, and visceral vascular manifestations. Infectious and ischemic central nervous system (CNS) manifestations due to embolism through pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) represent the main causes of morbidity. To improve the phenotypic characterization of HHT with PAVM, we conducted a retrospective multicenter study of patients with HHT and at least 1 PAVM detected by chest computed tomography (CT) and/or pulmonary angiography, with particular attention to CNS and infectious manifestations. The study included 126 patients (47 men, 79 women), with a mean age of 43.1 +/- 17.4 years; 45 patients had a mutation of the ENG gene and 16 had a mutation of ACVRL1. PAVMs were diagnosed as a result of systematic screening procedures (29%), incidental imaging findings (15%), dyspnea (22%), or CNS symptoms (13%). The PAVMs were diagnosed at a mean age of 43 +/- 17 years, with a linear distribution of diagnosis between 20 and 75 years. Dyspnea on exertion was present in 56% of patients. Four patients had a hemothorax, including 1 during pregnancy. Fifty-three CNS events directly related to HHT (excluding migraine) were observed in 35% of patients: cerebral abscess (19.0%), ischemic cerebral stroke (9.5%), transient cerebral ischemic attack (6.3%), and cerebral hemorrhage (2.4%). The median age of onset was 33 years for cerebral abscesses (range, 11-66 yr), and 53.5 years for ischemic cerebral events (range, 2-72 yr). Migraine was reported in 16% of patients. The diagnoses of PAVM and HHT were made at the time of the cerebral abscess in 13 cases (54%). Forty-three percent of patients were hypoxemic at rest. Contrast echocardiography showed intrapulmonary right-to-left shunting in 87% of tested patients. PAVMs were seen on chest radiograph in 54% of patients, and on the CT scan in all patients. One hundred five patients (83%) underwent treatment of the PAVM, by percutaneous embolization (71%) and/or by surgical resection (23%). A high frequency of CNS and infectious complications was observed in this large series of patients with HHT-related PAVM. Physicians may not be sufficiently aware of the clinical manifestations of this orphan disorder. Patients diagnosed with HHT should be informed by physicians and patient associations of the risk of PAVM-related complications, and systematic screening for PAVM should be proposed, regardless of a patient's symptoms, familial history, or genetic considerations.\n",

      "PMID:  12426051\n",
      "Abs: The pain of migraine is often throbbing suggesting an important role for the cranial blood vessels and their innervation by the trigeminal nerve. It is proposed that clinically effective anti-migraine compounds, such as 5-HT(1B/1D) agonists, have actions that include inhibiting calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release from trigeminal nerves. Human studies suggest that histamine can induce migraine possibly by activating nitric oxide (NO) synthase to promote endogenous NO production. The present studies investigated the effect of histamine and its antagonists on the cranial blood vessels using intravital microscopy to assess directly the diameter of dural arteries in sodium pentobarbitone anaesthetised rats. Electrical stimulation of a closed cranial window produces, by local depolarisation of nerves, dural vessel dilation that is monitored continuously on-line using video-microscopy and a video dimension analyser. Histamine infusion caused immediate and reproducible dilation of meningeal blood vessels (103.5+/-6%; n=40) that could be blocked by H(1)- (mepyramine) and H(2) (famotidine)-receptor antagonists (P<0.05), as well as a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methylester; P<0.05). Neurogenic dural vasodilation was not inhibited by H(2)-receptor antagonists, but was significantly inhibited by a H(1)-receptor antagonist at the high dose of 10 mg/kg. The present studies demonstrate that histamine is likely to activate NO synthase to promote NO production. There is also evidence that H(1)-receptors may be present on trigeminal neurones as the H(1)-receptor antagonist inhibited neurogenic vasodilation, albeit at a large dose.\n",

      "Abs: Clinical trials suggest that synthetic ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channel openers may cause headache and migraine by dilating cerebral and meningeal arteries. We studied the mRNA expression profile of K(ATP) channel subunits in the pig and human middle meningeal artery (MMA) and in the pig middle cerebral artery (MCA). We determined the order of potency of four K(ATP) channel openers when applied to isolated pig MMA and MCA, and we examined the potential inhibitory effects of the Kir6.1 subunit specific K(ATP) channel blocker PNU-37883A on K(ATP) channel opener-induced relaxation of the isolated pig MMA and MCA. Using conventional RT-PCR, we detected the mRNA transcripts of the K(ATP) channel subunits Kir6.1 and SUR2B in all the examined pig and human intracranial arteries. Application of K(ATP) channel openers to isolated pig MMA and MCA in myographs caused a concentration-dependent vasodilatation with an order of potency that supports the presence of functional SUR2B K(ATP) channel subunits. 10(-7) M PNU-37883A significantly inhibited the in vitro dilatory responses of the potent K(ATP) channel opener P-1075 in both pig MMA and MCA. In conclusion, our combined mRNA expression and pharmacological studies indicate that Kir6.1/SUR2B is the major functional K(ATP) channel complex in the pig MMA and MCA, and mRNA expression studies suggest that the human MMA shares this K(ATP) channel subunit profile. Specific blocking of Kir6.1 or SUR2B K(ATP) channel subunits in large cerebral and meningeal arteries may be a future anti-migraine strategy.\n",

Effects of CGRP 8-37 were also examined in rats that underwent MMT and sham operations. Protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of CGRP receptor components in the L3-L4 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) were investigated following MIA treatment. RESULTS: In both the MIA and MMT groups, the mechanical sensitivity of joint nociceptors was enhanced compared to that in the control groups. Exogenous CGRP increased mechanical sensitivity in a greater proportion of joint nociceptors in the MIA-treated rats than in the saline-treated rats. Local blockade of endogenous CGRP by CGRP 8-37 reversed both the MIA- and MMT-induced enhancement of joint nociceptor responses. Joint afferent cell bodies coexpressed the receptor for CGRP, called the calcitonin-like receptor (CLR), and the intracellular accessory CGRP receptor component protein. MIA treatment increased the levels of mRNA for CLR in the L3-L4 DRG and the levels of CLR protein in medium and large joint afferent neurons. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide new and compelling evidence implicating a role of CGRP in peripheral sensitization in experimental OA. Our novel finding of CGRP-mediated control of joint nociceptor mechanosensitivity suggests that the CGRP receptor system may be an important target for the modulation of pain during OA. CGRP receptor antagonists recently developed for migraine pain should be investigated for their efficacy against pain in OA.CI - © 2014 The Authors.

      "PMID:  19673898\n",
      "Abs: The role of nitric oxide (NO) in migraine has been studied in the experimental glyceryl trinitrate (GTN)-infusion headache model. We hypothesized that GTN-induced headache may activate the trigeminovascular system and be associated with increased levels of sensory neuropeptides, including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). CGRP, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and somatostatin plasma levels were measured before and after placebo/sumatriptan injection and during GTN-induced headache. Following a double-blind randomized cross-over design, 10 healthy volunteers received subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg or placebo. This was succeeded by 20 min of GTN (0.12 µg kg(-1) min(-1)) infusion. At baseline no subject reported headache (using verbal rating scale from 0 to 10) and the jugular CGRP-like immunoreactivity (-LI) level was 18.6 ± 2.5 pmol/l. After a 20-min intravenous infusion of GTN 0.12 µg kg(-1) min(-1), median peak headache intensity was 4 (range 2-6) (P < 0.05), while jugular CGRP-LI levels were unchanged (19.0 ± 2.8 pmol/l; P > 0.05). There were no changes in VIP-, NPY- or somatostatin-LI. In conclusion, the NO donor GTN appears not to induce headache via immediate CGRP release.\n",

      "PMID:  14718591\n",
      "Abs: Arachidonylethanolamide (anandamide, AEA) is believed to be the endogenous ligand of the cannabinoid CB(1) and CB(2) receptors. CB(1) receptors have been found localized on fibers in the spinal trigeminal tract and spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis. Known behavioral effects of anandamide are antinociception, catalepsy, hypothermia, and depression of motor activity, similar to Delta(9)-tetrahydocannanbinol, the psychoactive constituent of cannabis. It may be a possible therapeutic target for migraine. In this study, we looked at the possible role of the CB(1) receptor in the trigeminovascular system, using intravital microscopy to study the effects of anandamide against various vasodilator agents. Anandamide was able to inhibit dural blood vessel dilation brought about by electrical stimulation by 50%, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) by 30%, capsaicin by 45%, and nitric oxide by 40%. CGRP(8-37) was also able to attenuate nitric oxide (NO)-induced dilation by 50%. The anandamide inhibition was reversed by the CB(1) receptor antagonist AM251. Anandamide also reduced the blood pressure changes caused by CGRP injection, this effect was not reversed by AM251. It would seem that anandamide acts both presynaptically, to prevent CGRP release from trigeminal sensory fibers, and postsynaptically to inhibit the CGRP-induced NO release in the smooth muscle of dural arteries. CB(1) receptors seem to be involved in the NO/CGRP relationship that exists in causing headache and dural blood vessel dilation. It also seems that some of the blood pressure changes caused by anandamide are mediated by a noncannabinoid receptor, as AM251 was unable to reverse these effects. It can be suggested that anandamide is tonically released to play some form of modulatory role in the trigeminovascular system.\n",

      "PMID:  29660410\n",
      "Abs: The Drosophila gene c12.2 was isolated in a screen examining mRNA binding proteins. Drosophila c12.2 is the mouse Vwa8 homolog. Various genome-wide associated studies have linked human Vwa8 to both neurological and oncological pathologies, which include autism, bipolar disorder, comorbid migraine, and acute myeloid leukemia, however, the function and role of the VWA8 protein remain poorly understood. To further analyze the Vwa8 gene in mouse, gene structure, protein homology modeling, and gene expression patterns were examined throughout mouse development. Our analyses indicate that the mouse Vwa8 gene produces two transcripts; the full-length Vwa8a is highly expressed relative to the truncated Vwa8b transcript across all developmental time points and tissues analyzed. Protein homology modeling indicates that VWA8a belongs to a novel protein superfamily containing both the midasin and cytoplasmic dynein 1 heavy chain 1 proteins. These data establish the development timeline and expression profile for both Vwa8a and Vwa8b, paving the way for future studies to determine the cellular role(s) of this highly conserved protein family.CI - Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

      "PMID:  26891823\n",
      "Abs: It is widely accepted that efficacy and speed of current antidepressants' therapeutic effect are far from optimal. Thus, there is a need for the development of antidepressants with new mechanisms of action. The neuropeptide galanin and its receptors (GalR1, GalR2 and GalR3) are among the promising targets. However, it is not clear whether or not the galanin system is involved in the antidepressant effect exerted by the currently much used inhibitors of the reuptake of serotonin and/or noradrenaline. To answer this question we administered the selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine (40mg/kg/day via osmotic minipumps) to normal rats and examined the levels of the transcripts for galanin and GalR1-3 after a 3-week venlafaxine treatment in the dorsal raphe, hippocampus and frontal cortex. These areas are known to be involved in the effects of antidepressants and in depression itself. Venlafaxine failed to alter the expression of any of the galanin system genes in these areas. Our results show that one of the most efficient, currently used SNRIs does not alter transcript levels of galanin or its three receptors in normal rats. These findings suggest that the pro- and antidepressive-like effects of galanin reported in animal experiments may employ a novel mechanism(s).CI - Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

      "PMID:  24429644\n",
      "Abs: A 60-year-old man visited our hospital because of left hemiparesis in September 2006. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a high-intensity lesions in the right corona radiata on diffusion-weighted images and a high-intensity lesions in the basal ganglia and deep white matter on T2-weighted images. He recovered with no sequelae. Antithrombotic agents such as aspirin were given to prevent stroke, but stroke recurred three times over the course of 3 years. In February 2009, neurological examination revealed right hemiparalysis and dysarthria. Dysphagia and cognitive decline had been progressing gradually. We suspected cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) on the basis of the clinical and family history. An Arg75Pro mutation in the Notch3 gene was found, but did not involve a cysteine residue. Antithrombotic agents were ineffective. We tried lomerizine hydrochloride, which was reported to prevent stroke in a patient with CADASIL. In Japan, lomerizine hydrochloride is used to prevent migraine and to selectively inhibit cerebral artery contraction. During treatment with lomerizine hydrochloride (5 mg/day) for more than 3 years, there was no recurrence of cerebral infarction and no further deterioration of cognitive function or MRI findings. There is no evidence supporting the efficacy of antithrombotic agents in CADASIL patients. Moreover, antithrombotic agents have been reported to increase the frequency of clinically silent microbleeds on MRI in CADASIL. Lomerizine hydrochloride might therefore be one option for the treatment of CADASIL.\n",

      "Title: Tooth pulp inflammation increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression in rodent trigeminal ganglion neurons\n",
      "PMID:  20223282\n",
      "Abs: Nociceptive pathways with first-order neurons located in the trigeminal ganglion (TG) provide sensory innervation to the head, and are responsible for a number of common chronic pain conditions, including migraines, temporomandibular disorders and trigeminal neuralgias. Many of those conditions are associated with inflammation. Yet, the mechanisms of chronic inflammatory pain remain poorly understood. Our previous studies show that the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is expressed by adult rat TG neurons, and released from cultured newborn rat TG neurons by electrical stimulation and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a well-established mediator of trigeminal inflammatory pain. These data suggest that BDNF plays a role in activity-dependent plasticity at first-order trigeminal synapses, including functional changes that take place in trigeminal nociceptive pathways during chronic inflammation. The present study was designed to determine the effects of peripheral inflammation, using tooth pulp inflammation as a model, on regulation of BDNF expression in TG neurons of juvenile rats and mice. Cavities were prepared in right-side maxillary first and second molars of 4-week-old animals, and left open to oral microflora. BDNF expression in right TG was compared with contralateral TG of the same animal, and with right TG of sham-operated controls, 7 and 28 days after cavity preparation. Our ELISA data indicate that exposing the tooth pulp for 28 days, with confirmed inflammation, leads to a significant upregulation of BDNF in the TG ipsilateral to the affected teeth. Double-immunohistochemistry with antibodies against BDNF combined with one of nociceptor markers, CGRP or transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1), revealed that BDNF is significantly upregulated in TRPV1-immunoreactive (IR) neurons in both rats and mice, and CGRP-IR neurons in mice, but not rats. Overall, the inflammation-induced upregulation of BDNF is stronger in mice compared to rats. Thus, mouse TG provides a suitable model to study molecular mechanisms of inflammation-dependent regulation of BDNF expression in vivo.CI - Copyright 2010 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

      "PMID:  24788413\n",
      "Abs: Telcagepant potassium salt (MK-0974) is an oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor inhibitor investigated for the treatment of acute migraine. Under gastric pH conditions, the salt rapidly gels, then converts to an insoluble neutral form that creates an impervious shell on the tablet surface, resulting in a slow and variable release dissolution rate and poor bioavailability. Early attempts to develop a solid dosage form, including solid dispersion and nanosuspension formulations, resulted in low exposures in preclinical studies. Thus, a liquid-filled soft gelatin capsule (SGC) formulation (oblong 20) was used for clinical studies. However, a solid dosage form was desirable for commercialization. The slow dissolution of the tablet formulations was overcome by using a basifying agent, arginine, and inclusion of a nonionic surfactant, poloxamer 407. The combination of arginine and poloxamer in the formulation created a local transient basic microenvironment that promoted the dissolution of the salt and prevented rapid precipitation of the neutral form on the tablet surface to form the gel layer. The tablet formulation achieved fast absorption and comparable exposure to the SGC formulation. The final optimized 280 mg tablet formulation was successfully demonstrated to be bioequivalent to the 300 mg SGC formulation.CI - © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association.\n",

      "PMID:  12413405\n",
      "Abs: The impressive pain relief experienced by sufferers of dystonia and spasticity from intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin suggested that patients with other chronic, musculoskeletal pain conditions also may benefit. However, there have been relatively few placebo-controlled studies of botulinum toxin in such non-neurologic conditions as myofascial pain syndrome, chronic neck and low back pain, and fibromyalgia; the results of these studies have not been impressive. One explanation for the lack of positive findings may be the lack of clinically evident muscle spasms (overactivity), despite the presence of muscle tenderness, tightness, or trigger points. Clinical observations of pain relief from injections of botulinum toxin for dystonia and spasticity and its apparent efficacy in treating migraine suggest an anti-nociceptive action independent of its neuromuscular junction-blocking action. Evidence from animal experiments supports this notion, and other data provide plausible physiologic mechanisms in the periphery and central nervous systems. These involve modulation of the activity of the neurotransmitters glutamate, substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, enkephalins, and others. However, even if botulinum toxin is firmly established as an analgesic, there is insufficient clinical evidence of its efficacy in treating non-neurologic, chronic, musculoskeletal pain conditions.\n",

      "Abs: The cerebral vascular neuromuscular apparatus consists of a varicose perivascular nerve plexus at the adventitial-medial border and smooth muscle cells in the medial coat that are functionally connected. In addition to noradrenaline and acetylcholine, a number of putative non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic neurotransmitters have been identified in cerebral perivascular nerves, including serotonin, substance P, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, gastrin-releasing peptide, cholecystokinin, somatostatin, neurotensin, calcitonin gene-related peptide and neuropeptide Y. The role of adenosine-5'-triphosphate as a cotransmitter with noradrenaline in some perivascular sympathetic nerves, and of endothelial cells in mediating the vasodilatation produced by some neurohumoral agents is discussed. Speculations are made about the relation between vascular neuroeffector mechanisms and migraine, including the possibility of local vasospasm by serotoninergic nerves, reactive hyperaemia involving purine nucleotides and nucleosides, release of substance P from sensory nerve collaterals during antidromic ('axon reflex') impulses and secondary release of local agents such as prostanoids, histamine and bradykinin.\n",

      "Abs: Ubrogepant is a novel, oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist currently under US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review for the acute treatment of migraine attacks. This double-blind, four-period crossover study compared the cardiac repolarization effect of therapeutic (100 mg) and supratherapeutic (400 mg) ubrogepant doses vs. placebo in healthy adults. Moxifloxacin 400 mg was used as an open-label active control, and the primary end point was change from baseline in Fridericia-corrected QT intervals (ΔQTcF). Assay sensitivity was demonstrated via statistically significant QTcF prolongation with moxifloxacin vs. placebo. After single oral doses of ubrogepant, the least squares mean placebo-corrected ΔQTcF (ΔΔQTcF) and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) did not exceed the 10-millisecond regulatory threshold at any timepoint. The 90% CI upper bounds were 2.46 milliseconds and 2.69 milliseconds for ubrogepant 100 and 400 mg, respectively. Categorical and concentration-based analyses were consistent with the primary result, showing no significant impact of ubrogepant on cardiac repolarization.CI - © 2019 ALLERGAN plc.

      "Abs: We report a new method herein coined SP-CLipPA (solid-phase cysteine lipidation of a peptide or amino acid) for the synthesis of mono-S-lipidated peptides. This technique utilizes thiol-ene chemistry for conjugation of a vinyl ester to a free thiol of a semiprotected, resin-bound peptide. Advantages of SP-CLipPA include: ease of handling, conversions of up to 91 %, by-product removal by simple filtration, and a single purification step. Additionally, the desired lipidated products show high chromatographic separation from impurities, thus facilitating RP-HPLC purification. To showcase the utility of SP-CLipPA, we synthesized a potent calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist peptide in excellent yield and purity. This peptide, selected from a series of lipidated analogues of CGRP(8-37) and CGRP(7-37) , has potential for the treatment of migraine.CI - © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.\n",

      "Abs: The role of adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) and of the ligand-gated P2X3 receptor in neuronal dorsal root ganglia (DRG) pain transmission is relatively well established. Much less is known about the purinergic system in trigeminal ganglia (TG), which are involved in certain types of untreatable neuropathic and inflammatory pain, as well as in migraine. Emerging data suggest that purinergic metabotropic P2Y receptors on both neurons and satellite glial cells (SGCs) may also participate in both physiological and pathological pain development. Here, we provide an updated literature review on the role of purinergic signaling in sensory ganglia, with special emphasis on P2Y receptors on SGCs. We also provide new original data showing a time-dependent downregulation of P2Y2 and P2Y4 receptor expression and function in purified SGCs cultures from TG, in comparison with primary mixed neuron-SGCs cultures. These data highlight the importance of the neuron-glia cross-talk in determining the SGCs phenotype. Finally, we show that, in mixed TG cultures, both adenine and guanosine induce intracellular calcium transients in neurons but not in SGCs, suggesting that also these purinergic-related molecules can participate in pain signaling. These findings may have relevant implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies for chronic pain treatment.\n",

      "PMID:  19558535\n",
      "Abs: The release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and sensitization of the trigeminal nerve system are important elements in migraine pathophysiology. Sensitization can be induced by topical meningeal administration of inflammatory soup (IS). CGRP release is a marker of trigeminal nerve activation. We examined the effect of intracisternal IS administration on CGRP release in rat jugular vein blood at baseline, 2 and 15 min after the beginning of IS infusion. IS administration caused a significant increase of CGRP levels after 2 and 15 min compared with baseline. Daily oral treatment with topiramate for 4 and 8 weeks led to a dose- and time-dependent reduction of IS-induced CGRP release. Sumatriptan also attenuated stimulated neuropeptide release. These results indicate that intracisternal IS administration leads to activation of the trigeminal system. The inhibition of CGRP release by topiramate offers a possible mechanism that may in part account for the preventative antimigraine activity of this drug.\n",

      "PMID:  26850715\n",
      "Abs: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), the most common hereditary cerebral small vessel disease, is caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene on chromosome 19. Clinical manifestations of CADASIL include recurrent transient ischemic attacks, strokes, cognitive defects, epilepsy, migraine and psychiatric symptoms. Parkinsonian features have variably been reported in CADASIL patients, but only a few patients showed a clear parkinsonian syndrome. We studied two patients, a pair of monozygotic twins, carrying the R1006C mutation of the NOTCH3 gene and affected by a parkinsonian syndrome. For the first time in CADASIL patients, we used transcranial sonography (TCS) to assess basal ganglia abnormalities. TCS showed a bilateral hyperechogenic pattern of substantia nigra in one twin, and a right hyperechogenic pattern in the other. In both patients, lenticular nuclei showed a bilateral hyperechogenic pattern, and the width of the third ventricle was slightly increased. The TCS pattern found in our CADASIL patients is characteristic neither for Parkinson's disease, nor for vascular parkinsonism and seems to be specific and related to the disease-specific pathological features.\n",

      "Abs: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading cause of inherited mental retardation, due to expansion and methylation of the CGG sequence at the 5' UTR of the FMR1 gene. Around 90% of affected boys present with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), while this percentage is lower in FXS girls (35-47%). Treatment of these behavioral symptoms is critical for many families. In an attempt at identifying drugs capable of restoring the activity of the FMR1 gene, we investigated the use of valproic acid (VPA), a well-known antiepileptic drug, also used as a mood stabilizer and in migraine therapy. It is described as an inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC) and, possibly, as a DNA demethylating agent. In an in vitro study we observed that treatment of lymphoblastoid cells from FXS patients with VPA caused a modest reactivation of FMR1 transcription and increased levels of histone acetylation, confirming the histone hyperacetylating effect, but not its putative DNA demethylating activity. On the basis of these findings, we decided to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of VPA on ADHD symptoms in FXS patients. We observed an improvement in the adaptive behavior, defined as the performance of daily activities required for personal and social competence, due to a significant reduction in hyperactivity after VPA treatment. This treatment could be considered as an alternative to that with stimulants, whose efficacy in patients with FXS needs to be confirmed by further studies.CI - (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.\n",

      "Abs: A 55-year-old man with no history of stroke or migraine presented to the clinic with cognitive impairment and depression that had been experiencing for two years. Neurological examination showed bilateral pyramidal signs, and impairments in cognition and attention. Brain MRI revealed multiple lacunar lesions and microbleeds in the deep cerebral white matter, subcortical regions, and brainstem, as well as diffuse white matter hyperintensities without anterior temporal pole involvement. Cerebral single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) revealed bilateral hypoperfusion in the basal ganglia. Gene analysis revealed an arginine-to-proline missense mutation in the NOTCH3 gene at codon 75. The patient was administered lomerizine (10 mg/day), but the patient's cognitive impairment and cerebral atrophy continued to worsen. Follow-up testing with MRI three years after his initial diagnosis revealed similar lacunar infarctions, cerebral microbleeds, and diffuse white matter hyperintensities to those observed three years earlier. However, MRI scans revealed signs of increased cerebral blood flow. Together, these findings suggest that the patient's cognitive impairments may have been caused by pathogenesis in the cerebral cortex.\n",

      "Abs: Here, we report two cases of episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2) in a 63-year-old woman and her 36-year-old daughter. The mother experienced recurrent attacks of cerebellar dysfunction lasting 4 to 5 hours since the age of 41 years. On several occasions, she was admitted to the emergency room, where she was diagnosed with epilepsy or stroke. Based on these diagnoses, she was treated with antiepileptic or anticoagulant drugs, but both treatments were eventually discontinued. The frequency of the attacks increased after the patient reached the age of 62. Interictal neurological examination demonstrated signs of slight cerebellar ataxia, i.e. saccadic eye movements, gaze-directed nystagmus, and mild truncal ataxia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed cerebellar vermis atrophy. Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed various spike and wave patterns: solitary spikes, spike-and-slow wave complexes, and slow wave bursts. Photoparoxysmal response (PPR) type 3 was also observed. Treatment with acetazolamide abolished the patient's attacks almost completely. The daughter started experiencing 5- to 10-minute ataxic episodes at the age of 16 years. Based on her epileptiform EEG activities with PPR (type 2), antiepileptic drugs (valproate and zonisamide) were prescribed. Despite pharmacological treatment, the attacks recurred; however, their frequency gradually decreased with time, until they almost entirely disappeared when the patient was 33. Unfortunately, migraine-like headaches arose instead. Subtle truncal ataxia was observed during interictal periods. Sanger sequencing of the exons of the CACNA1A gene revealed a novel single base deletion (c.3575delA) in both patients. Despite the difference in age of onset and clinical course, both patients showed clearly epileptiform EEG activities without experiencing the concurrent epileptic episodes. Thus, EA2 is a disease that may be misdiagnosed as epilepsy or stroke in the field of emergency medicine.\n",

      "Abs: CADASIL disease (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy) was described in 1991 by Tourmier-Lasserve. Two years later the same authors described its association with chromosome 19; nonetheless, the mutations in gene Notch3 were not described until 1996. Clinical findings depend on the age at onset. The early form of the illness is found in young patients, generally less than 30 years old, and the main clinical manifestation is a migraine headache with subcortical lesions in the white matter, while in the later form ischemic events and behavioral symptoms are predominant. Anatomo-pathological findings in CADASIL include the presence of osmophilic granular deposits in vessel walls, skin, muscles and cerebral arteries. We present a patient with CADASIL and cavernous angioma. We studied a 40-year-old woman who underwent surgery for a left temporal-parietal cavernous angioma, with aphasia as the only symptom, two years before admission. Her family history showed that her father had suffered from vascular dementia. She was admitted to our hospital with right-side hemiparesis and dysarthria. A CT scan showed the presence of ischemic vascular lesions and former surgery sequelae. The duplex scan of the neck vessels and a transesophageal echocardiogram ruled out an embolic source. Laboratory tests including VDRL, HIV, prothrombotic profile and rheumatologic screening tests were normal. An MRI in T2W and FLAIR showed the presence of multiple subcortical cerebral lesions and hyperintensity in the white matter (leukoencephalopaty). We found a left acute putaminal-capsular infarct in the diffusion-MRI. The MRA was normal. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid was unremarkable. A molecular DNA test was performed, and a nucleotide substitution in position 583 in exon 4 of gene Notch3 was detected. This mutation was found only in CADASIL patients. The association with cavernous angioma has not been previously reported, and we believe that it was unrelated to CADASIL, either clinically or genetically. To our knowledge, this is the first case of CADASIL diagnosed by molecular DNA test in our country.\n",

      "Title: Updated Progress of Nanocarrier-Based Intranasal Drug Delivery Systems for Treatment of Brain Diseases\n",
      "PMID:  30317945\n",
      "Abs: Intranasal drug delivery is emerging as a reliable and promising pathway to deliver a wide range of therapeutic agents including small and large molecules, peptides and proteins, genes to the central nervous system for the treatment of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, depression, migraine, schizophrenia, and glioma. This presents noninvasive entry into the brain via direct nose-to-brain and/or indirect nose-to-blood-to-brain routes. Several nanocarrier-based strategies have been developed to transport therapeutic agents to the brain including nanoparticles, liposomes, and exosomes following intranasal delivery. However, the multiple barriers in nose-to-brain route - including rapid mucociliary clearance in the nasal cavity, enzyme degradation, and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) - pose serious challenges to brain-targeted drug delivery. Hence, very limited translation from the laboratory to the clinic has been achieved. The present review highlights the surface modification of nanocarriers with different strategies devoted to facilitate nose-to-brain delivery: prolonging retention time in the nasal cavity, improving penetration ability, and promoting brain targeting with ligands. Additionally, in vitro blood-brain barrier models, influencing an efficient study on intranasal delivery of therapeutics into the brain through indirect nose-to-blood-to-brain pathway, is discussed.\n",

      "PMID:  27142867\n",
      "Abs: Single episodes of cortical spreading depression (CSD) are believed to cause typical migraine aura, whereas clusters of spreading depolarizations have been observed in cerebral ischemia and subarachnoid hemorrhage. We recently demonstrated that the release of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) from cortical neurons after CSD in a rodent model is dependent on the number of CSD episodes, such that only multiple CSD episodes can induce significant HMGB1 release. Here, we report that only multiple CSD inductions caused microglial hypertrophy (activation) accompanied by a greater impact on the transcription activity of the HMGB1 receptor genes, TLR2 and TLR4, while the total number of cortical microglia was not affected. Both an HMGB1-neurtalizing antibody and the HMGB1 inhibitor glycyrrhizin abrogated multiple CSD-induced microglial hypertrophy. Moreover, multiple CSD inductions failed to induce microglial hypertrophy in TLR2/4 double knockout mice. These results strongly implicate the HMGB1-TLR2/4 axis in the activation of microglia following multiple CSD inductions. Increased expression of the lysosomal acid hydrolase cathepsin D was detected in activated microglia by immunostaining, suggesting that lysosomal phagocytic activity may be enhanced in multiple CSD-activated microglia.\n",

      "Title: Genetically Intact but Functionally Impaired HIV-1 Env Glycoproteins in the T-Cell Reservoir\n",
      "PMID:  29187544\n",
      "Abs: HIV-infected subjects under antiretroviral treatment (ART) harbor a persistent viral reservoir in resting CD4(+) T cells, which accounts for the resurgence of HIV replication after ART interruption. A large majority of HIV reservoir genomes are genetically defective, but even among intact proviruses few seem able to generate infectious virus. To understand this phenomenon, we examined the function and expression of HIV envelope glycoproteins reactivated from the reservoir of four HIV-infected subjects under suppressive ART. We studied full-length genetically intact env sequences from both replicative viruses and cell-associated mRNAs. We found that these Env proteins varied extensively in fusogenicity and infectivity, with strongest functional defects found in Envs from cell-associated mRNAs. Env functional impairments were essentially explained by defects in Env protein expression. Our results support the idea that defects in HIV Env expression, preventing cytopathic or immune HIV clearance, contribute to the persistence of the HIV T-cell reservoir in vivoIMPORTANCE In most individuals, evolution of HIV infection is efficiently controlled on the long-term by combination antiviral therapies. These treatments, however, fail to eradicate HIV from the infected subjects, a failure that results both in resurgence of virus replication and in resumption of HIV pathogenicity when the treatment is stopped. HIV resurgence, in these instances, is widely assumed to emerge from a reservoir of silent virus integrated in the genomes of a small number of T lymphocytes. The silent HIV reservoir is mostly composed of heavily deleted or mutated HIV DNA. Moreover, among the seemingly intact remaining HIV, only very few are actually able to efficiently propagate in tissue culture. In this study, we find that intact HIV in the reservoir often carry strong defects in their capacity to promote fusion to neighboring cells and infection of target cells, a defect related to the function and expression of the HIV envelope glycoprotein. Impaired envelope glycoprotein expression and function could explain why cells harboring these viruses tend to remain undetected and unharmed in the reservoir.CI - Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.\n",

      "PMID:  15936815\n",
      "Abs: Women are more than three times as likely as men to experience migraine headaches and temporomandibular joint pain, and painful episodes are often linked to the menstrual cycle. To understand how hormone levels may influence head and face pain, we assessed expression of pain-associated neuropeptides and estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) during the natural estrous cycle in mice. Gene expression was analyzed in the trigeminal ganglia of cycling female mice at proestrus, estrus and diestrus using RT-PCR. Peptide/protein expression in trigeminal neurons was analyzed using immunohistochemistry. ERalpha mRNA was present at all stages and highest at estrus. ERalpha protein was present in the cytoplasm of medium-sized and small trigeminal neurons. ERalpha immunoreactive neurons were most common at diestrus. CGRP and ANP mRNAs did not change across the estrous cycle, while expression of galanin and NPY mRNAs were strongly linked to the estrous cycle. Galanin mRNA levels peaked at proestrus, when expression was 8.7-fold higher than the diestrus levels. Galanin immunoreactivity also peaked at proestrus. At proestrus, 7.5% of trigeminal neurons contained galanin, while at estrus, 6.2% of trigeminal neurons contained galanin, and at diestrus, 4.9% of trigeminal neurons contained galanin. NPY mRNA peaked at estrus, when levels were 4.7-fold higher than at diestrus. Our findings suggest that estrogen receptors in trigeminal neurons modulate nociceptive responses through effects on galanin and NPY. Variations in neuropeptide content in trigeminal neurons across the natural estrous cycle may contribute to increases in painful episodes at particular phases of the menstrual cycle.\n",

      "PMID:  22033344\n",
      "Abs: Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and its receptors (PAC1, VPAC) are present in sensory neurons and vascular smooth muscle. PACAP infusion was found to trigger migraine-like headache in humans and we showed its central pro-nociceptive function in several mouse pain models. Nitroglycerol (NTG)-induced pathophysiological changes were investigated in this study in PACAP gene-deleted (PACAP(-/-)) and wildtype (PACAP(+/+)) mice. Chemical activation of the trigeminovascular system was induced by 10 mg/kg i.p. NTG. Light-aversive behavior was determined in a light-dark box, meningeal microcirculation by laser Doppler blood perfusion scanning and the early neuronal activation marker c-Fos with immunohistochemistry. NTG-induced photophobia both in the early (0-30 min) and late phases (90-120 min) due to direct vasodilation and trigeminal sensitization, respectively, was significantly reduced in PACAP(-/-) mice. Meningeal blood flow increased by 30-35% during 4 h in PACAP(+/+) mice, but only a 5-10% elevation occurred from the second hour in PACAP(-/-) ones. The number of c-Fos expressing cells referring to neuronal activation in the trigeminal ganglia and nucleus caudalis significantly increased 4h after NTG in PACAP(+/+), but not in PACAP(-/-) animals. Similar PAC1 receptor immunostaining was detected in both groups, which did not change 4 h after NTG treatment. PACAP-38 (300 μg/kg, i.p.) produced photophobia similarly to NTG and 30% meningeal vasodilatation for 30 min in PACAP(+/+), but not in PACAP(-/-) mice. It significantly increased neural activation 4h later in the trigeminal ganglia of both groups, but in the nucleus caudalis of only the PACAP(+/+) mice. We provide the first experimental results that PACAP is a pivotal mediator of trigeminovascular activation/sensitization and meningeal vasodilation related to migraine.CI - Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

      "Title: Diet-Induced Obesity Enhances TRPV1-Mediated Neurovascular Reactions in the Dura Mater\n",
      "PMID:  28133727\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: Exploring the pathophysiological changes in transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) receptor of the trigeminovascular system in high-fat, high-sucrose (HFHS) diet-induced obesity of experimental animals. BACKGROUND: Clinical and experimental observations suggest a link between obesity and migraine. Accumulating evidence indicates that metabolic and immunological alterations associated with obesity may potentially modulate trigeminovascular functions. A possible target for obesity-induced pathophysiological changes is the TRPV1/capsaicin receptor which is implicated in the pathomechanism of headaches in a complex way. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a regular (n = 25) or HFHS diet (n = 26) for 20 weeks. At the end of the dietary period, body weight of the animals was normally distributed in both groups and it was significantly higher in animals on HFHS diet. Therefore, experimental groups were regarded as control and HFHS diet-induced obese groups. Capsaicin-induced changes in meningeal blood flow and release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from dural trigeminal afferents were measured in control and obese rats. The distribution of TRPV1- and CGRP-immunoreactive meningeal sensory nerves was also compared in whole mount preparations of the dura mater. Metabolic parameters of the animals were assessed by examining glucose and insulin homeostasis as well as plasma cytokine concentrations. RESULTS: HFHS diet was accompanied by reduced food consumption and greater fluid and energy intakes in addition to increased body weight of the animals. HFHS diet increased fasting blood glucose and insulin concentrations as well as levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and interleukin-6. In obese animals, dural application of the archetypal TRPV1 agonist capsaicin resulted in significantly augmented vasodilatory and vasoconstrictor responses as compared to controls. Diet-induced obesity was also associated with enhanced basal and capsaicin-induced CGRP release from meningeal afferents ex vivo. Except for minor morphological changes, the distribution of dural TRPV1- and CGRP-immunoreactive afferents was similar in control and obese animals. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that obesity induced by long-term HFHS diet results in sensitization of the trigeminovascular system. Changes in TRPV1-mediated vascular reactions and CGRP release are pathophysiological alterations that may be of relevance to the enhanced headache susceptibility of obese individuals.CI - © 2017 American Headache Society.\n",

      "Abs: LY2951742, a monoclonal antibody targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), is being developed for migraine prevention and osteoarthritis pain. To support the clinical development of LY2951742, capsaicin-induced dermal blood flow (DBF) was used as a target engagement biomarker to assess CGRP activity in nonhuman primates and healthy volunteers. Inhibition of capsaicin-induced DBF in nonhuman primates, measured with laser Doppler imaging, was dose dependent and sustained for at least 29 days after a single intravenous injection of the CGRP antibody. This information was used to generate a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model, which correctly predicted inhibition of capsaicin-induced DBF in humans starting at a single subcutaneous 5-mg dose. As expected, the degree of inhibition in capsaicin-induced DBF increased with higher LY2951742 plasma concentrations. Utilization of this pharmacodynamic biomarker with pharmacokinetic data collected in phase I studies provided the dose-response relationship that assisted in dose selection for the phase II clinical development of LY2951742.CI - Copyright © 2015 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.\n",

      "Abs: Adrenomedullin is related to the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) family and is present in cerebral blood vessels. It may be involved in migraine mechanisms. We measured the change in dural and pial artery diameter, mean arterial blood pressure and local cerebral blood flow flux (LCBF(Flux)) after intravenous (i.v.) infusion of adrenomedullin. The study was performed in the presence or absence of the CGRP1 (calcitonin-receptor-like-receptor (CALCRL)/receptor activity-modifying protein-1 (RAMP1)) receptor antagonists BIBN4096BS, CGRP-(8-37) and the adrenomedullin receptor antagonist adrenomedullin-(22-52). I.v. infusion of 15 mug kg(-1) adrenomedullin (n=8) induced dilatation of dural (32+/-7.5%) and pial (18+/-5.5%) arteries, a reduction in mean arterial blood pressure (19+/-3%) and an increase in LCBF(Flux) (16+/-8.4%). The duration of the responses was 25 min for the dural artery, while the response of the pial artery lasted for 15 min. The CGRP1-receptor antagonists BIBN4096BS and CGRP-(8-37) and the adrenomedullin receptor antagonist adrenomedullin-(22-52) significantly inhibited the effect of adrenomedullin (n=7, P<0.05 for both arteries) on dural and pial artery diameter and mean arterial blood pressure. No significant inhibition of LCBF(Flux) was found. The antagonist alone had no effect on mean arterial blood pressure or LCBF(Flux). In conclusion, we suggest that adrenomedullin in the rat cranial circulation dilates dural and pial arteries, reduces mean arterial blood pressure and increases LCBF(Flux), probably via a CGRP1-receptor.\n",

      "PMID:  26990646\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Intravenous infusion of calcitonin-gene-related-peptide (CGRP) provokes headache and migraine in humans. Mechanisms underlying CGRP-induced headache are not fully clarified and it is unknown to what extent CGRP modulates nociceptive processing in the brain. To elucidate this we recorded blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signals in the brain by functional MRI after infusion of CGRP in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study of 27 healthy volunteers. BOLD-signals were recorded in response to noxious heat stimuli in the V1-area of the trigeminal nerve. In addition, we measured BOLD-signals after injection of sumatriptan (5-HT1B/1D antagonist). RESULTS: Brain activation to noxious heat stimuli following CGRP infusion compared to baseline resulted in increased BOLD-signal in insula and brainstem, and decreased BOLD-signal in the caudate nuclei, thalamus and cingulate cortex. Sumatriptan injection reversed these changes. CONCLUSION: The changes in BOLD-signals in the brain after CGRP infusion suggests that systemic CGRP modulates nociceptive transmission in the trigeminal pain pathways in response to noxious heat stimuli.\n",

      "PMID:  26679946\n",
      "Abs: Magnesium (Mg(2+)) is the second most abundant cellular cation and is essential for all stages of life, from the early embryo to adult. Mg(2+) deficiency causes or contributes to many human diseases, including migraine headaches, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, hypotension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiac arrhythmias. Although the concentration of Mg(2+) in the extracellular environment can vary significantly, the total intracellular Mg(2+) concentration is actively maintained within a relatively narrow range (14 - 20 mM) via tight, yet poorly understood, regulation of intracellular Mg(2+)by Mg(2+) transporters and Mg(2+)-permeant ion channels. Recent studies have continued to add to the growing number of Mg(2+) transporters and ion channels involved in Mg(2+) homeostasis, including TRPM6 and TRPM7, members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel family. Mutations in TRPM6, including amino acid substitutions that prevent its heterooligomerization with TRPM7, occur in the rare autosomal-recessive disease hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (HSH). Genetic ablation of either gene in mice results in early embryonic lethality, raising the question of whether these channels' capacity to mediate Mg(2+) influx plays an important role in embryonic development. Here we review what is known of the function of Mg(2+) in early development and summarize recent findings regarding the function of the TRPM6 and TRPM7 ion channels during embryogenesis.\n",

      "PMID:  26618768\n",
      "Abs: A 57-year-old man developed migraine at the age of 25 years. Thereafter, he developed depression at the age of 50 years, and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital at the age of 54 years because of deteriorating depression. He returned to his work after receiving treatment for depression; however, he made mistakes several times in his work. He was referred to our hospital for further neurological evaluation. The results of the neurological examination performed on admission were unremarkable. His Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 24/30, and neuropsycological evaluations revealed executive dysfunction. There was no family history of dementia or cerebral infarction. Magnetic resonance fluid attenuated inversion recovery (MR FLAIR) image of the brain showed hyperintense lesions around the lateral ventricle without involvement in the temporal pole and external capsule. Despite a lack of family history of dementia and cerebral infarction and non-specific brain MRI findings, his history of headache and depression were suggestive of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). Therefore, skin biopsy was performed; electron microscopy of the biopsied sample revealed granular osmiophilic material deposits. Genetic analysis of the NOTCH3 gene showed a missense mutation with substitution of R427C in exon 8, i.e., out of the hot-spot, exon 3, and 4. Thus, skin biopsy is a useful tool for diagnosing atypical CADASIL.\n",

      "PMID:  25366616\n",
      "Abs: Spreading depolarization (SD) is a wave of almost complete depolarization of the neuronal and glial cells. Nowadays there is sufficient evidence demonstrating its pathophysiological effect in migraine with aura, transient global amnesia, stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, and traumatic brain injury. In these cases, occurrence of SD has been associated with functional neuronal damage, neuronal necrosis, neurological degeneration, and poor clinical outcome. Animal models show that SD can be modulated by drugs that interfere with its initiation and propagation. There are many pharmacological targets that may help to suppress SD occurrence, such as Na⁺, K⁺, Cl⁻, and Ca²⁺ channels; Na⁺/K⁺ -ATPase; gap junctions; and ligand-based receptors, for example, adrenergic, serotonin, sigma-1, calcitonin gene-related peptide, GABAA, and glutamate receptors. In this regard, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blockers, in particular, ketamine, have shown promising results. Therefore, theoretically pharmacologic modulation of SD could help diminish its pathological effects.\n",

      "PMID:  23572112\n",
      "Abs: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene, with a striking variability in phenotypic expression. To date, only two homozygous patients have been reported, with divergent phenotypic features. We describe an Italian CADASIL patient, homozygous for G528C mutation, in whom early manifestation of the disease was migraine, but whose clinical evolution was characterized by a reversible acute encephalopathy followed by full recovery (\"CADASIL coma\"). Clinical evaluation, MR scan, neuropsychological and neurophysiological investigation did not reveal substantial differences between our homozygous patient and her heterozygous relatives sharing the same mutation, or between our patient and a group of heterozygous individuals with the same mutation but from different families. Skin biopsy identified peculiar features in the homozygous patient, with cytoplasmic pseudoinclusions likely containing granular osmiophilic material (GOM) in the vascular smooth muscle cells, but further studies are necessary to substantiate their possible relationships with CADASIL homozygosis. \"CADASIL coma\" did not seem to be specific of patient's homozygosis, since it was observed in one of her heterozygous relatives, whereas its pathogenesis seems to be related to peculiar constellations of unknown predisposing factors. The present study demonstrated that CADASIL conforms to the classical definition of dominant diseases, according to which homozygotes and heterozygotes for a defect are phenotypically indistinguishable.\n",

      "PMID:  2701377\n",
      "Abs: The occurrence and distribution of peptide-containing nerve fibers to the cerebral circulation are described. Immunocytochemical studies have revealed that cerebral blood vessels are invested with nerve fibers containing neuropeptide Y (NPY), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI), substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). In addition, there are studies reporting the occurrence of putative neurotransmitters such as cholecystokinin, dynorphin B, galanin, gastrin releasing peptide, vasopressin, neurotensin, and somatostatin. The nerves occur as a longitudinally oriented network around large cerebral arteries. There is often a richer supply of nerve fibers around arteries than veins. The origin of these nerve fibers has been studied by retrograde tracing and denervation experiments. These techniques, in combination with immunocytochemistry, have revealed a rather extensive innervation pattern. Several ganglia, such as the superior cervical ganglion, the sphenopalatine ganglion, the otic ganglion, and small local ganglia at the base of the skull, contribute to the innervation. Sensory fibers seem to derive from the trigeminal ganglion, the jugular-nodose ganglionic complex, and from dorsal root ganglia at level C2. The noradrenergic and most of the NPY fibers derive from the superior cervical ganglion. A minor population of the NPY-containing fibers contains VIP instead of NA and emanates from the sphenopalatine ganglion. The cholinergic and the VIP-containing fibers derive from the sphenopalatine ganglion, the otic ganglion, and from small local ganglia at the base of the skull. Most of the SP-, NKA-, and CGRP-containing fibers derive from the trigeminal ganglion. Minor contributions may emanate from the jugular-nodose ganglionic complex and from the spinal dorsal root ganglia. NPY is a potent vasoconstrictor in vitro and in situ. VIP, PHI, SP, NKA, and CGRP act via different mechanisms to induce cerebrovascular dilatation. The sympathetic, the parasympathetic, and the sensory systems appear to be involved in modulating cerebrovascular tone in hypertension and in conditions of threatening vasoconstriction, e.g., subarachnoid hemorrhage and migraine.\n",

A total of 94 individuals with a total of 556 plasma samples contributed to the analysis. Subjects received a single dose of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 or 10 mg BIBN 4096 BS administered in a 10 min i.v. infusion. Blood samples were obtained at selected times up to 12 h. Disposition of BIBN 4096 BS was best described with a three compartment body model with first order elimination. BIBN 4096 BS showed a moderate degree (between 30 and 50%) of inter-subject variability in the apparent volume of distribution of the central compartment (V1), total plasma clearance (CL), distribution clearance between the central and deep compartment, and the apparent volume of distribution of the shallow compartment. Typical estimates of V1 were significantly (P <0.01) lower in healthy volunteers (7.16 versus 9.95 L), and typical estimates of CL were significantly lower in subjects receiving oral contraceptives (11.4 versus 17.1 L/h), although the absolute reduction in the unexplained inter-subject variability was negligible (4%). Computer simulations showed that the above mentioned covariates lack clinical significance. In conclusion, the pharmacokinetics of BIBN 4096 BS was independent of the dose and not altered by the tested covariates to a clinically significant degree.\n",

      "PMID:  11181905\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a potent vasodilatory and cardiotonic peptide, has a potential role for CGRP in diverse physiologic and pathophysiologic situations such as congestive heart failure, diabetes, migraine, and neurogenic inflammation. Although a peptide CGRP receptor antagonist, CGRP(8-37,) is available, its utility presents significant limitations for these indications. Here, we describe the properties of SB-(+)-273779 [N-methyl-N-(2-methylphenyl)-3-nitro-4-(2-thiazolylsulfinyl)nitrobenzanilide], a selective nonpeptide antagonist of CGRP(1) receptor. SB-(+)-273779 inhibited (125)I-labeled CGRP binding to SK-N-MC (human neuroblastoma cells) and human cloned CGRP(1) receptor with K(i) values of 310 +/- 40 and 250 +/-15 nM, respectively. SB-(+)-273779 also inhibited CGRP (3 nM)-activated adenylyl cyclase in these systems with IC(50) values of 390 +/-10 nM (in SK-N-MC) and 210 +/-16 nM (recombinant human CGRP receptors). Prolonged treatment (>30 min) of SK-N-MC cells with SB-(+)-273779 followed by extensive washing resulted in reduction in maximum CGRP-mediated adenylyl cyclase activity, suggesting that this compound has irreversible binding characteristics. In addition, SB-(+)-273779 antagonized CGRP-mediated 1) stimulation of intracellular Ca(2+) in recombinant CGRP receptors in HEK-293 cells, 2) inhibition of insulin-stimulated [(14)C]deoxyglucose uptake in L6 cells, 3) vasodilation in rat pulmonary artery, and 4) decrease in blood pressure in anesthetized rats. SB-(+)-273779 tested at 3 microM had no significant affinity for calcitonin, endothelin, angiotensin II, and alpha-adrenergic receptors under standard ligand binding assays. SB-(+)-273779 also did not inhibit forskolin and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide. These results suggest that SB-(+)-273779 is a valuable tool for studying CGRP-mediated functional responses in complex biological systems.\n",

Recently, mutations in the SLC20A2 gene coding for the inorganic phosphate transporter PiT2 were linked to PFBC, thereby implicating impaired phosphate transport as an underlying disease mechanism. To date, around 20 families of various ethnicities carry different mutations in SLC20A2 correlate with ~40% of PFBC cases. More recently, two French families were recently reported with mutations in PDGFRB: c.1973T>C, p.L658P and c.2959C>T, p.R987W, a class III tyrosine kinase receptor. Six other families were found with mutations in PDGFB, and, in general, mutations at the PDGF pathway add a new dimension to the physiopathology of PFBC so far explained by a disturbance in phosphate homeostasis with SLC20A2. The identification of SLC20A2, PDGFRB, and PDGFB provides a new avenue for potential treatments based on compounds such as bisphosphonates and those modulating the PDGFB pathway.CI - © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

      "Title: Clinical Features of CADASIL\n",
      "PMID:  12480760\n",
      "Abs: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a rare hereditary disease characterized by recurrent transient ischemic attacks, strokes, and vascular dementia. Various mutations in the Notch3 gene cause the disease, whereas the mechanism of how they cause the disorder remains unknown. We recently identified two Japanese CADASIL families with an R141C mutation. The mean age of onset was 44.6, and the main symptoms were recurrent strokes and progressive motor disturbances in extremities, as well as pseudobulbar palsy. Besides those in white matter and basal ganglia, ischemic lesions in temporal edge and corpus callosum were present on magnetic resonance images, which seemed to be characteristic of CADASIL. Moreover, in our cases, nocturnal arterial blood pressure fall was significantly lower in patients compared with control subjects, suggesting that it might be partly associated with ischemic lesions in deep white matter in CADASIL. We also compared Japanese and Caucasian CADASIL cases and found that dementia and pseudobulbar palsy were observed more frequently in Japanese patients, although typical migraine was rather rare. In the present study, we describe the clinical features of CADASIL, hoping to help reveal the mechanism of chronic ischemic brain diseases, including leukoaraiosis or Binswanger's disease.\n",

      "PMID:  11245715\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an inherited, autosomal dominant condition caused by mutations of the Notch3 gene. Affected individuals have migraine, mood disturbance, and recurrent strokes, often progressing to subcortical dementia and premature death. MRI findings include focal lacunar infarcts and diffuse T2-weighted hyperintensity, or leukoaraiosis. However, such findings are seen much more commonly in patients with cardiovascular risk factors, particularly hypertension, where they are believed to represent cerebral small vessel disease. No previous study has sought to identify specific radiologic markers of CADASIL. METHODS: MRI scans from 20 consecutive patients with CADASIL and 20 patients with sporadic leukoaraiosis due to presumed small-vessel disease were compared using the previously validated semiquantitative MRI rating scale devised by Scheltens et al. Analysis was blinded to clinical category. RESULTS: Scores for hyperintensities of the temporal white matter and external capsule-insula region were significantly higher in patients with CADASIL. Hyperintensity confined to the pole of the temporal lobe was a characteristic finding in CADASIL, occurring in 19 patients with CADASIL but no patients with ischemic leukoaraiosis. Involvement of the external capsule, though less specific, was seen early in the disease course. In a few patients with CADASIL, involvement of the corpus callosum was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Temporal pole hyperintensity is a radiologic marker of CADASIL. Involvement of the external capsule and corpus callosum are also characteristic findings that may help to distinguish the disease.\n",

      "PMID:  12678157\n",
      "Abs: The authors report the first Thai family with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) in which the family members had a classical history of progressive vascular dementia. The proband was a 31-year old Thai male who presented with an acute stroke in the subcortical region. His past history revealed mental disturbance, including poor judgement and regressive behavior as well as mood changes for 1 year. He did not have a history of migraine or any other vascular risk factors except for a strong family history of ischemic stroke and progressive dementia. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated multiple small infarctions in the subcortical white matter of the bilateral frontal, parietal and occipital lobes with another small lesion in the pons. Genetic study demonstrated a Notch 3 mutation consisting of the substitution of a nucleotide at position 406 in exon 3 leading to the replacement of an Arginine by Cysteine at position 110 in the 2nd EGF motif, which is compatable with CADASIL.\n",

      "PMID:  12133041\n",
      "Abs: 5-HT1D (but not 5-HT1B)-receptor immunoreactivity (i.r.) can be detected on trigeminal fibres within the spinal trigeminal tract of the human brainstem. The present study used immunohistochemical and morphometric techniques to determine the proportions of trigeminal fibres expressing substance P, CGRP or 5-HT1D-receptor immunoreactivities. Co-localization studies between 5-HT1D-receptor and substance P- or CGRP-i.r. were also performed. Brainstem material was obtained with consent (four donors) and the total number of immunoreactive fibres within the trigeminal tract was estimated using random field sampling. A greater proportion of fibres (>1 microm diameter) expressed CGRP-i.r. (80 +/- 6%) compared with substance P-i.r. (46 +/- 7%) or 5-HT1D-receptor-i.r. (25 +/- 1%). 5-HT1D-receptor-i.r. was co-localized on some CGRP- or substance P-i.r. fibres. This suggests that 5-HT1D-receptors can regulate the release of CGRP and substance P and may be relevant to the clinical effectiveness of 5-HT1B/1D-receptor agonists in the treatment of migraine and other cranial pain syndromes.\n",

      "PMID:  11286896\n",
      "Abs: Vasospasm can have many different causes and can occur in a variety of diseases, including infectious, autoimmune, and ophthalmic diseases, as well as in otherwise healthy subjects. We distinguish between the primary vasospastic syndrome and secondary vasospasm. The term \"vasospastic syndrome\" summarizes the symptoms of patients having such a diathesis as responding with spasm to stimuli like cold or emotional stress. Secondary vasospasm can occur in a number of autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, rheumatoid polyarthritis, giant cell arteritis, Behcet's disease, Buerger's disease and preeclampsia, and also in infectious diseases such as AIDS. Other potential causes for vasospasm are hemorrhages, homocysteinemia, head injury, acute intermittent porphyria, sickle cell disease, anorexia nervosa, Susac syndrome, mitochondriopathies, tumors, colitis ulcerosa, Crohn's disease, arteriosclerosis and drugs. Patients with primary vasospastic syndrome tend to suffer from cold hands, low blood pressure, and even migraine and silent myocardial ischemia. Valuable diagnostic tools for vasospastic diathesis are nailfold capillary microscopy and angiography, but probably the best indicator is an increased plasma level of endothelin-1. The eye is frequently involved in the vasospastic syndrome, and ocular manifestations of vasospasm include alteration of conjunctival vessels, corneal edema, retinal arterial and venous occlusions, choroidal ischemia, amaurosis fugax, AION, and glaucoma. Since the clinical impact of vascular dysregulation has only really been appreciated in the last few years, there has been little research in the according therapeutic field. The role of calcium channel blockers, magnesium, endothelin and glutamate antagonists, and gene therapy are discussed.\n",

      "PMID:  21905600\n",
      "Abs: INTRODUCTION: Cervical artery dissection is a major cause of cerebral ischemia in young adults and can lead to various clinical symptoms, some of which are benign (e.g. headache, neck pain, Horner's syndrome, and cranial nerve palsy). However, most patients have a stroke or transient ischemic attack. EPIDEMIOLOGY: The incidence of cervical artery dissection is low and is estimated to be around 2.6 per 100,000 inhabitants. Mortality and short-term recurrence rates are low: however; they may have been underestimated. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY: Although the pathophysiology is still unclear constitutional and partly genetic susceptibility of the arterial wall has been proposed as a causal factor; triggered by infection or minor trauma. PREDISPOSING FACTORS: In addition to the trauma to the neck, other risk fractors have been suggested, such as infection, migraine, hyperhomocisteinamia, and the 67TT genotype of the 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase gene although evidence is sparse. GENETIC FACTORS: Cervical artery dissection is now considered a multifactorial disease caused by several genetic abnormalities and environmental factors acting synergistically. CONCLUSION: Research aimed at improving our understanding of the environmental and genetic factors predisposing to cervical artery dissection and assessment of long-term outcomes of this disease is needed. Better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and the natural history of the disease through large prospective multicentre cohorts could also be helpful to improve therapeutic and preventive strategies. Several mutlticentre efforts are already under way to meet these needs.\n",

      "PMID:  15221337\n",
      "Abs: A cerebral arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy is described with a pedigree suggestive for an autosomal dominant condition. In contrast to the vasculopathy designated with the acronym CADASIL, no deposits of granular osmiophilic material were detected in the vasculature and no point mutations in the NOTCH 3 gene were found. The disease occurred in a family living near Hamburg, Germany, and affected 11 women and 11 men over the last six generations. Onset of the disease was between the age of 12 and 50. Clinical symptoms included gait disturbances, dysarthria, sensomotoric deficits and a progressive dementia. Migraine-like complaints and epileptic seizures were observed in one case each. Cranial computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans showed large confluent areas with decreased density in the white matter and small necroses in the brain stem, the basal ganglia and the white matter. A correlation with factors predisposing for vascular diseases could not be demonstrated. In five cases an autopsy was performed which disclosed an angiopathy affecting predominantly the penetrating arteries with consecutive lacunar infarcts, diffuse demyelination and rarefication of the subcortical white matter and degeneration of the pyramidal tracts. Histologically, the vessels showed concentric and excentric intimal proliferation, an elastosis and hyalinosis, splitting of the lamina elastica interna and a degeneration of the tunica muscularis. Electron microscopy revealed fragmentation and thickening of the basal lamina but electron-dense granules characteristic for CADASIL were not detected.\n",

      "PMID:  11168879\n",
      "Abs: A 14-year-old Chinese boy with a normal perinatal and early developmental history presented at 5 years of age with migraine, intractable epilepsy, ataxia, supraventricular tachycardia, paralytic ileus and progressive mental deterioration. Computerized tomography revealed multiple cerebral infarcts in the parieto-occipital region without basal ganglial calcification. Magnetic resonance imaging showed increased signal intensity in T2 weighted images in the same regions. A cerebral digital subtraction angiogram was normal. Venous lactate, pyruvate, lactate to pyruvate ratio and cerebrospinal fluid lactate were elevated. Muscle biopsy did not reveal any ragged red fibres; dinucleotide-tetrazolium reductase activity was normal. Mitochondrial DNA analysis detected an adenine to guanine mutation at nucleotide position 3243 of tRNALeu(UUR). All four tissues analysed demonstrated heteroplasmy: leucocyte 56%, hair follicle 70%; buccal cell 64%; muscle 54%. The mother and brother of the proband, both asymptomatic, were also found to have a heteroplasmic A3243G mutation in the leucocytes, hair follicle and buccal cells. Other members of the maternal lineage, including the maternal grandmother, did not have the mutation. This report describes a patient with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes, who presented with multisystem involvement. The absence of ragged red fibres in muscle biopsy did not preclude the diagnosis. Mutational analysis of mitochondrial DNA conveniently confirmed the diagnosis of the disorder. A de novo mutation is demonstrated in this family.\n",

      "PMID:  15021241\n",
      "Abs: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article reviews the most significant advances in the field of genetics of the epilepsies during the past year, with emphasis on newly identified genes and functional studies leading to new insights into the pathophysiology of epilepsy. RECENT FINDINGS: Mutations in the chloride channel gene CLCN2 have been associated with the most common forms of idiopathic generalized epilepsies. A mutation in the ATP1A2 sodium potassium ATPase pump gene has been described in a family in which familial hemiplegic migraine and benign familial infantile convulsions partly co-segregate. The leucine-rich, glioma-inactivated 1 gene (LGI1) (also known as epitempin) was found to be responsible for autosomal-dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy in additional families. The serine-threonine kinase 9 gene (STK9) was identified as the second gene associated with X-linked infantile spasms. Mutations in the Aristaless-related homeobox gene (ARX) have been recognized as a cause of X-linked infantile spasms and sporadic cryptogenic infantile spasms. A second gene underlying progressive myoclonus epilepsy of Lafora, NHLRC1, was shown to code for a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase. SUMMARY: Genes associated with idiopathic generalized epilepsies remain within the ion channel family. Mutations in non-ion channel genes are responsible for autosomal-dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy, a form of idiopathic focal epilepsy, malformations of cortical development, and syndromes that combine X-linked mental retardation and epilepsy. Most genetic epilepsies have a complex mode of inheritance, and genes identified so far account only for a minority of families and sporadic cases. Functional studies are leading to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying hyperexcitability and seizures.\n",

      "Title: Endosomal proteolysis regulates calcitonin gene-related peptide responses in mesenteric arteries\n",
      "PMID:  22881710\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a potent vasodilator, implicated in the pathogenesis of migraine. CGRP activates a receptor complex comprising, calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1). In vitro studies indicate recycling of CLR●RAMP1 is regulated by degradation of CGRP in early endosomes by endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1). However, it is not known if ECE-1 regulates the resensitization of CGRP-induced responses in functional arterial tissue. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: CLR, ECE-1a-d and RAMP1 expression in rat mesenteric artery smooth muscle cells (RMA-SMCs) and mesenteric arteries was analysed by RT-PCR and by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. CGRP-induced signalling in cells was examined by measuring cAMP production and ERK activation. CGRP-induced relaxation of arteries was measured by isometric wire myography. ECE-1 was inhibited using the specific inhibitor, SM-19712. KEY RESULTS: RMA-SMCs and arteries contained mRNA for CLR, ECE-1a-d and RAMP1. ECE-1 was present in early endosomes of RMA-SMCs and in the smooth muscle layer of arteries. CGRP induced endothelium-independent relaxation of arteries. ECE-1 inhibition had no effect on initial CGRP-induced responses but reduced cAMP generation in RMA-SMCs and vasodilation in mesenteric arteries responses to subsequent CGRP challenges. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: ECE-1 regulated the resensitization of responses to CGRP in RMA-SMCs and mesenteric arteries. CGRP-induced relaxation did not involve endothelium-derived pathways. This is the first report of ECE-1 regulating CGRP responses in SMCs and arteries. ECE-1 inhibitors may attenuate an important vasodilatory pathway, implicated in primary headaches and may represent a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of migraine.CI - © 2012 The Authors.

      "PMID:  18221935\n",
      "Abs: Clinical and basic science data support an integral role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in migraine pathology. Following trigeminal nerve activation, afferent release of CGRP causes vasodilation while efferent release leads to pain. Although CGRP can also be secreted from cell bodies of trigeminal neurons located within the ganglion, the function of CGRP released in the ganglion is poorly understood. Initially, we showed that SNAP-25, a protein required for CGRP release, was localized in cell bodies of trigeminal ganglia neurons. We also found that satellite glial cells in the ganglia express the CGRP1 receptor protein RAMP1. To determine whether CGRP could directly activate glial cells, primary cultures of rat trigeminal ganglia were utilized to study the effects of CGRP on glial nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and release. Under our culture conditions, >95% of the cells expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein and RAMP1. While weak iNOS staining was observed in glia under basal conditions, CGRP treatment greatly increased glial iNOS expression and NO release. This stimulatory effect was blocked by the CGRP1 receptor antagonist, CGRP(8-37) peptide. Treatment of glial cultures with forskolin or cAMP also increased iNOS expression and stimulated NO release to levels similar to CGRP. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that activation of CGRP1 receptors regulates glial iNOS and NO release. We propose that following trigeminal nerve activation, CGRP secretion from neuronal cell bodies activates satellite glial cells that release NO and initiate inflammatory events in the ganglia that contribute to peripheral sensitization in migraine.\n",

      "Title: Valproic acid prevents retinal degeneration in a murine model of normal tension glaucoma\n",
      "PMID:  25555796\n",
      "Abs: Valproic acid (VPA) is widely used for treatment of epilepsy, mood disorders, migraines and neuropathic pain. It exerts its therapeutic benefits through modulation of multiple mechanisms including regulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate neurotransmissions, activation of pro-survival protein kinases and inhibition of histone deacetylase. The evidence for neuroprotective properties associated with VPA is emerging. Herein, we investigated the therapeutic potential of VPA in a mouse model of normal tension glaucoma (NTG). Mice with glutamate/aspartate transporter gene deletion (GLAST KO mice) demonstrate progressive retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss and optic nerve degeneration without elevated intraocular pressure, and exhibit glaucomatous pathology including glutamate neurotoxicity and oxidative stress in the retina. VPA (300mg/kg) or vehicle (PBS) was administered via intraperitoneal injection in GLAST KO mice daily for 2 weeks from the age of 3 weeks, which coincides with the onset of glaucomatous retinal degeneration. Following completion of the treatment period, the vehicle-treated GLAST KO mouse retina showed significant RGC death. Meanwhile, VPA treatment prevented RGC death and thinning of the inner retinal layer in GLAST KO mice. In addition, in vivo electrophysiological analyses demonstrated that visual impairment observed in vehicle-treated GLAST KO mice was ameliorated with VPA treatment, clearly establishing that VPA beneficially affects both histological and functional aspects of the glaucomatous retina. We found that VPA reduces oxidative stress induced in the GLAST KO retina and stimulates the cell survival signalling pathway associated with extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (ERK). This is the first study to report the neuroprotective effects of VPA in an animal model of NTG. Our findings raise intriguing possibilities that the widely prescribed drug VPA may be a novel candidate for treatment of glaucoma.CI - Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "PMID:  22305629\n",
      "Abs: Triptans, a family of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 1B, 1D, and 1F receptor agonists, are used in the acute treatment of migraine attacks. The site of action and subtypes of the 5-HT(1) receptor that mediate the antimigraine effect have still to be identified. This study investigated the mRNA expression of these receptors and the role of 5-HT(1) receptor subtypes in controlling the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in rat dura mater, trigeminal ganglion (TG), and trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC). The mRNA for each receptor subtype was quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. A high potassium concentration was used to release CGRP from dura mater, isolated TG, and TNC in vitro. The immunoreactive CGRP (iCGRP) release was measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay. The mRNA transcripts of the 3 5-HT(1) receptor subtypes were detected in the trigeminovascular system. Sumatriptan inhibited iCGRP release by 31% in dura mater, 44% in TG, and 56% in TNC. This effect was reversed by a 5-HT(1B/1D) antagonist (GR127395). The 5-HT(1F) agonist (LY-344864) was effective in the dura mater (26% iCGRP inhibition), and the 5-HT(1D) agonist (PNU-142633) had a significant effect in the TNC (48%), whereas the 5-HT(1B) agonist (CP-94253) was unable to reduce the iCGRP release in all tissues studied. We found that sumatriptan reduced the iCGRP release via activation of 5-HT(1D) and 5-HT(1F) receptor subtypes. The 5-HT(1F) receptor agonist was effective only in peripheral terminals in dura mater, whereas the 5-HT(1D) agonist had a preferential effect on central terminals in the TNC.CI - Copyright Â© 2012 International Association for the Study of Pain.

      "PMID:  10781675\n",
      "Abs: Neurogenic vasodilation in cranial arteries may be an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of migraine headache. We describe a novel, in vitro assay to characterise neurogenic vasodilator responses in endothelium-denuded segments of rabbit isolated basilar artery, with particular focus on calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP). In arterial segments precontracted with prostaglandin F(2alpha), relaxations evoked by exogenously applied alphaCGRP (EC(50)=2.9 nM) were inhibited by alphaCGRP-(8-37) (pA(2)=6.49) or by desensitisation resulting from prior exposure to alphaCGRP. Relaxations evoked by exogenously applied vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) (EC(50)=2.5 nM) were inhibited by VIP-(7-28) 1 microM. The 5-HT(1) receptor agonists L-771,331 ((3S)-3[N-(S)-alpha-methylbenzyl]aminomethyl-(S)-1-[2-(5-(2-oxo-1, 3-oxazolidin-4-ylmethyl)-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]pyrrolidine) and sumatriptan exerted contractile effects (EC(50)=293 and 95 nM, respectively). In neurogenic experiments, vasodilation evoked by electrical field stimulation was markedly attenuated by pre-treatment with capsaicin (10 microM) or by prior CGRP receptor desensitisation and to a lesser extent by pre-treatment with VIP-(7-28) 1 microM. L-771,331 (100 nM) exerted a weak inhibitory effect, marked only by a short reduction in the recovery time (post-electrical stimulation) and sumatriptan (30 nM) had no effect. The neurogenic response was potentiated by alphaCGRP-(8-37) 1 microM (reversible on wash-out). Short application (5-10 min) of capsaicin (10 microM) produced vasodilation that was inhibited by alphaCGRP-(8-37) 1 microM. These data suggest that electrically evoked neurogenic vasodilation in rabbit basilar artery has a large component resulting from the release of sensory neuropeptides in particular CGRP and a smaller component involving the release of VIP.\n",

      "PMID:  15228501\n",
      "Abs: Several studies suggest that a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist may have antimigraine properties, most probably via the inhibition of CGRP-induced cranial vasodilatation. We recently showed that the novel selective CGRP receptor antagonist, BIBN4096BS (1-piperidinecarboxamide, -N-[2-[[5-amino-1-[[4-(4-pyridinyl)-1-piperazinyl] carbonyl] pentyl]amino]-1-[(3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxyphenyl) methyl]-2-oxoethyl]-4-(1,4-dihydro-2-oxo-3(2H)-quinazolinyl)-, [[R-(R,(R*,S*)]), attenuated the CGRP-induced porcine carotid vasodilatation in a model predictive of antimigraine activity. In order to evaluate the potential safety of BIBN4096BS in migraine therapy, this study was designed to investigate the effects of intravenous BIBN4096BS on alpha-CGRP-induced systemic and regional haemodynamic changes in anaesthetised rats, using radioactive microspheres. In vehicle-pretreated animals, consecutive intravenous infusions of alpha-CGRP (0.25, 0.5 and 1 microg kg(-1) min.(-1)) dose-dependently decreased mean arterial blood pressure with an accompanying increase in heart rate and systemic vascular conductance whereas cardiac output remained unchanged. Alpha-CGRP also increased the vascular conductance to the heart, brain, gastrointestinal tract, adrenals, skeletal muscles and skin, whilst that to the kidneys, spleen, mesentery/pancreas and liver remained unaltered. The above systemic and regional haemodynamic responses to alpha-CGRP were clearly attenuated in BIBN4096BS (3 mg kg(-1) intravenously)-pretreated animals. These results indicate that exogenously administered alpha-CGRP dilates regional vascular beds via CGRP receptors on the basis of the antagonism produced by BIBN4096BS. Moreover, the fact that BIBN4096BS did not alter baseline haemodynamics suggests that endogenously produced CGRP does not play an important role in regulating the systemic and regional haemodynamics under resting conditions.\n",

      "Title: Deficiency of female sex hormones augments PGE2 and CGRP levels within midbrain periaqueductal gray\n",
      "PMID:  25175853\n",
      "Abs: The midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) is a substantial component of the descending modulatory network to control on nociceptive transmission and autonomic functions. Also, accumulated evidence has suggested that the PAG plays a crucial role in regulating migraine headache, a neurovascular disorder. The purpose of this study was to employ ELISA methods to examine the levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) in the PAG of rats who received ovariectomy and subsequent hormone replacement with 17β-estradiol, progesterone, or the combination of 17β-estradiol and progesterone. In addition, using Western blot analysis we examined expression of subtypes of PGE2 receptor in the PAG of rats with different conditions of female sex hormones. Results of our study demonstrated that lack of female sex hormones significantly increased the levels of PGE2 and CGRP in the dorsolateral PAG (P < 0.05) as well as expression of PGE2 EP3 receptors (P < 0.05). Furthermore, a liner relationship was observed between PGE2 and CGRP in the PAG (r = 092, P < 0.01). Also, inhibiting EP3 receptors by chronic administration of L-798106 (EP3 antagonist) into the lateral ventricles significantly attenuated expression of CGRP in the PAG of ovariectomized animals (P < 0.05 vs. vehicle control). Overall, our findings for the first time show that (1) circulating 17β-estradiol and/or progesterone influences the levels of PGE2 and CGRP in the PAG; (2) a lower level of 17β-estradiol and/or progesterone augments PGE2 and its EP3 receptor; and (3) PGE2 plays a role in regulating expression of CGRP in the PAG.CI - Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

      "Title: Gene dosage-dependent transmitter release changes at neuromuscular synapses of CACNA1A R192Q knockin mice are non-progressive and do not lead to morphological changes or muscle weakness\n",
      "PMID:  16111830\n",
      "Abs: Ca(v)2.1 channels mediate neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and at many central synapses. Mutations in the encoding gene, CACNA1A, are thus likely to affect neurotransmitter release. Previously, we generated mice carrying the R192Q mutation, associated with human familial hemiplegic migraine type-1, and showed first evidence of enhanced presynaptic Ca(2+) influx [Neuron 41 (2004) 701]. Here, we characterize transmitter release in detail at mouse R192Q NMJs, including possible gene-dosage dependency, progression of changes with age, and associated morphological damage and muscle weakness. We found, at low Ca(2+), decreased paired-pulse facilitation of evoked acetylcholine release, elevated release probability, and increased size of the readily releasable transmitter vesicle pool. Spontaneous release was increased over a broad range of Ca(2+) concentrations (0.2-5mM). Upon high-rate nerve stimulation we observed some extra rundown of transmitter release. However, no clinical evidence of transmission block or muscle weakness was found, assessed with electromyography, grip-strength testing and muscle contraction experiments. We studied both adult ( approximately 3-6 months-old) and aged ( approximately 21-26 months-old) R192Q knockin mice to assess effects of chronic elevation of presynaptic Ca(2+) influx, but found no additional or progressive alterations. No changes in NMJ size or relevant ultrastructural parameters were found, at either age. Our characterizations strengthen the hypothesis of increased Ca(2+) flux through R192Q-mutated presynaptic Ca(v)2.1 channels and show that the resulting altered neurotransmitter release is not associated with morphological changes at the NMJ or muscle weakness, not even in the longer term.\n",

      "PMID:  21917976\n",
      "Abs: Although laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strains are largely resistant to the human restriction factor TRIM5α (hTRIM5α), we have recently shown that some viruses carrying capsid (CA) sequences from clinical isolates can be more sensitive to this restriction factor. In this study we evaluated the contribution to this phenotype of CA mutations known to be associated with escape from cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. Recombinant viruses carrying HIV-1 CA sequences from NL4-3 and three different clinical isolates were prepared, along with variants in which mutations associated with CTL resistance were modified by site-directed mutagenesis, and the infectivities of these viruses in target cells expressing hTRIM5α and cells in which TRIM5α activity had been inhibited by overexpression of TRIM5γ were compared. For both hTRIM5α-sensitive viruses studied, CTL-associated mutations were found to be responsible for this phenotype. Both CTL resistance mutations occurring within HLA-restricted CA epitopes and compensatory mutations occurring outside CTL epitopes influenced hTRIM5α sensitivity, and mutations associated with CTL resistance selected in prior hosts can contribute to this effect. The impact of CTL resistance mutations on hTRIM5α sensitivity was context dependent, because mutations shown to be responsible for the TRIM5α-sensitive phenotype in viruses from one patient could have little or no impact on this parameter when introduced into another virus. No fixed relationship between changes in hTRIM5α sensitivity and infectivity was discernible in our studies. Taken together, these findings suggest that CTL mutations may influence HIV-1 replication by modifying both viral infectivity and sensitivity to TRIM5α.\n",

      "PMID:  31324668\n",
      "Abs: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene which maps to the short arm of chromosome 19 and encodes the NOTCH3 receptor protein, predominantly expressed in adults by vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes. The receptor has a large extracellular domain with 34 epidermal growth factor-like repeats encoded by exons 2-24, the site at which CADASIL mutations are most commonly found. Migraine with aura is often the earliest feature of the disease, with an increased susceptibility to cortical spreading depression suggested as a possible aetiological mechanism. Stroke, acute encephalopathy and cognitive impairment can also occur. Hypertension and smoking are associated with early age of onset of stroke. It diffusely affects white matter, with distinct findings on T2- weighted MRI, involving the external capsule, anterior poles of the temporal lobe and superior frontal gyri, displaying a characteristic pattern of leucoencephalopathy. Affected individuals have a reduced life expectancy. An effective treatment for CADASIL is not available. The authors describe a 35-year-old manwith an unremarkable medical history, presenting to the emergency department with slurred speech and increased confusion 3 days following a fall. He was a smoker and consumed 16 units of alcohol weekly. He was hypertensive and tachycardic. Physical examination confirmed increased tone in his lower limbs and dysarthria. His CT head showed severe cerebral atrophy, multiple small old infarcts and moderate background microvascular disease. Further investigation with an MRI head confirmed multiple white matter abnormalities with microhaemorrhages. The possibility of a hereditary vasculopathy was rendered as the appearances were thought consistent with a diagnosis of CADASIL. Genetic testing identified the NOTCH3 gene thus confirming the diagnosis.

      "PMID:  17666428\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP), a potent vasodilator that mediates inflammatory pain, is elevated in migraine; nevertheless, little is known about its release from sensory neurons. In this study, CGRP was found to occur in the majority of neurons from rat trigeminal ganglia, together with the three exocytotic SNAREs [SNAP25, syntaxin 1 and the synaptobrevin (Sbr, also known as VAMP) isoforms] and synaptotagmin. Ca(2+)-dependent CGRP release was evoked with K(+)-depolarisation and, to lower levels, by capsaicin or bradykinin from neurons that contain the vanilloid receptor 1 and/or bradykinin receptor 2. Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) type A cleaved SNAP25 and inhibited release triggered by K(+) > bradykinin >> capsaicin. Unlike BoNT type D, BoNT type B did not affect exocytosis, even though the neurons possess its receptor and Sbr II and Sbr III got proteolysed (I is resistant in rat) but, in mouse neurons, it additionally cleaved Sbr I and blocked transmitter release. Sbr I and II were found in CGRP-containing vesicles, and each was shown to separately form a SNARE complex. These new findings, together with punctate staining of Sbr I and CGRP in neurites, implicate isoform Sbr I in exocytosis from large dense-core vesicles together with SNAP25 (also, probably, syntaxin 1 because BoNT type C1 caused partial cleavage and inhibition); this differs from Sbr-II-dependent release of transmitters from small synaptic vesicles. Such use of particular Sbr isoform(s) by different neurons raises the functional implications for other cells previously unrecognised.\n",

      "PMID:  12654333\n",
      "Abs: Human dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) were obtained during various procedures and processed for single and double in situ hybridisation using oligonucleotide probes complementary to three peptide mRNAs. Some postmortem ganglia were also analysed. In donor (unlesioned) DRGs 12.5% of the neuron profiles (NPs) were galanin mRNA-positive (mRNA(+)), 47.5% calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) mRNA(+) and 32.7% substance P mRNA(+). The corresponding percentages for cervical/thoracic DRGs from patients suffering from severe brachial plexus injury were 32.8%, 57.4% and 34.5%, respectively. In these DRGs a high proportion of the galanin mRNA(+) NPs contained CGRP mRNA and substance P mRNA. In DRGs from a patient with migraine-like pain a comparatively small proportion expressed galanin, whereas in DRGs from a herpes zoster patient galanin mRNA(+) NPs were comparatively more frequent. The results from human postmortem DRGs revealed only weak peptide mRNA signals. The present results demonstrate that galanin is expressed in DRGs not only in a number of animal species including monkey as previously shown, but also in a considerable proportion of human DRG neurons, often together with CGRP and substance P, and mostly in small neurons. Thus, galanin may play a role in processing of sensory information, especially pain, in human DRGs and dorsal horn. However, to what extent a similarly dramatic upregulation of galanin expression can be seen after peripheral nerve lesion in man, as has been reported for rat, mouse and monkey, remains to be analysed.\n",

      "PMID:  19309356\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Migraine is a disabling neurological disorder involving activation, or the perception of activation, of trigeminovascular afferents containing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Released CGRP from peripheral trigeminal afferents causes dilatation of dural blood vessel, and this is used to measure trigeminal nerve activation. Kainate receptors with the GluR5 subunit (iGluR5, ionotropic glutamate receptor) are present in the trigeminal ganglion and may be involved in nociception. We investigated the possible involvement of prejunctional iGluR5 kainate receptors on CGRP release from trigeminal afferents. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We used neurogenic dural vasodilatation, which involves reproducible vasodilatation in response to CGRP release after electrical stimulation of the dura mater surrounding the middle meningeal artery. The effects of the specific iGluR5 receptor antagonist UBP 302 and agonist (S)-(-)-5-iodowillardiine were investigated on neurogenic and CGRP-induced dural vasodilatation in rats, by using intravital microscopy. KEY RESULTS: Administration of 10 and 20 mg.kg(-1) of iodowillardiine inhibited electrically induced dural vessel dilatation, an effect blocked by pretreatment with 50 mg.kg(-1) UBP 302. Administration of the iGluR5 receptor antagonist UBP 302 alone had no significant effect. CGRP (1 mg.kg(-1))-induced dural vasodilatation was not inhibited by the iGluR5 receptor agonist iodowillardiine. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This study demonstrates that activation of the iGluR5 kainate receptors with the selective agonist iodowillardiine is able to inhibit neurogenic dural vasodilatation probably by inhibition of prejunctional release of CGRP from trigeminal afferents. Taken together with recent clinical studies the data reinforce CGRP mechanisms in primary headaches and demonstrate a novel role for kainate receptor modulation of trigeminovascular activation.\n",

      "PMID:  29397368\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Headache is the most common neurological symptom and a leading cause of years lived with disability. We sought to identify the genetic variants associated with a broadly-defined headache phenotype in 223,773 subjects from the UK Biobank cohort. METHODS: We defined headache based on a specific question answered by the UK Biobank participants. We performed a genome-wide association study of headache as a single entity, using 74,461 cases and 149,312 controls. RESULTS: We identified 3343 SNPs which reached the genome-wide significance level of P<5×10(-8). The SNPs were located in 28 loci, with the top SNP of rs11172113 in the LRP1 gene having a P value of 4.92×10(-47). Of the 28 loci, 14 have previously been associated with migraine. Among 14 new loci, rs77804065 with a P value of 5.87×10(-15) in the LINC02210-CRHR1 gene was the top SNP. Significant relationships between multiple brain tissues and genetic associations were identified through tissue expression analysis. We also identified significant positive genetic correlations between headache and many psychological traits. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that brain function is closely related to broadly-defined headache. In addition, we found that many psychological traits have genetic correlations with headache.CI - Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "PMID:  10566974\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and adrenomedullin (ADM) are potent dilators of human brain arteries, and they have been implicated in the neurogenic inflammation underlying migraine headache and in the evolution of stroke, respectively. However, little is known about the presynaptic and postsynaptic distribution of their respective receptors in the human cerebrovascular bed and trigeminovascular system. In the current study, the expression of mRNA for ADM and the two cloned human CGRP1 receptors (identified here as A-CGRP1 receptors [Aiyar et al., 1996] and K-CGRP1 receptors) [Kapas and Clark, 1995] were evaluated in human brain vessels and trigeminal ganglia. Further, the ability of CGRP and ADM to activate adenylate cyclase in cerebromicrovascular and astroglial cell cultures was determined, and the receptors involved were characterized pharmacologically. Isolated human pial vessels, intracortical microvessels, and capillaries, as well as cultures of brain endothelial (EC), smooth muscle (SMC), and astroglial (AST) cells, all expressed mRNA for the two cloned CGRP1 receptors; however, message for the K-CGRP1 receptor was barely detectable in microvascular tissues and cells. In contrast, only isolated capillaries and cultured AST exhibited message for the ADM receptor. In human trigeminal ganglia, mRNA for ADM and the two CGRP1 receptors was systematically present. The CGRP dose-dependently increased (up to 50-fold) cAMP formation in cell cultures, an effect significantly blocked by 0.1 to 10 micromol/L of the CGRP1 receptor antagonist CGRP8-37. The ADM receptor agonist, ADM13-52 (1 micromol/L), similarly increased cAMP production in all cell types, and this response was virtually abolished by 1 micromol/L CGRP8-37. Low concentrations (1 to 10 micromol/L) of the ADM receptor antagonist ADM22-52 blocked the ADM13-52-induced cAMP formation in AST (26% at 10 micromol/L, P < 0.05), whereas they potentiated this response in brain EC and SMC (40% and 100%, P < 0.001, respectively). Even at a higher dose (50 micromol/L), ADM22-52 inhibited the ADM13-52 effect in vascular cells (45%) much less effectively than in AST (95%). These results indicate that both CGRP and ADM can affect human brain vessels through a CGRP1 receptor, and they further suggest the presence of functional ADM receptors in human astroglial cells.\n",

      "PMID:  20689142\n",
      "Abs: Non-syndromic familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAADs), inherited in an autosomal dominant manner in up to 19% of patients, are genetically heterogeneous. The ACTA2 gene, which encodes the vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC)-specific isoform of alpha-actin, is known to cause TAADs and occlusive vascular diseases, including coronary artery disease and premature ischemic stroke. We have investigated a Korean family with DeBakey type I aortic dissection related to pregnancy and a strong family history of TAADs. All affected family members underwent surgical repair of the ascending aorta. Other clinical features of familial TAAD, including inguinal hernias, iris flocculi, and livedo reticularis, were not observed. Histologic studies of aortic tissues showed medial degeneration and SMC hyperplasia in the aorta, consistent with previous observations. Molecular analyses of the ACTA2 gene showed a novel heterozygous missense mutation (c.76G>T; p.Asp26Tyr). Further analysis of a female patient and members of her family revealed that two affected sisters and her asymptomatic son had the same mutation. The novel Asp26Tyr mutation resides in SM alpha-actin subdomain 1 and is linked to TAAD with hypertrophy and disarray of SMCs and severe migraine, but not to livedo reticularis or iris flocculi. This study expands the spectrum of mutations of the ACTA2 gene by identifying a novel missense mutation. This is the first report of a pathologically- and genetically-confirmed family with TAAD in Korea.\n",

      "PMID:  20925600\n",
      "Abs: Serotonin receptors are the product of 15 distinct genes, 14 of which are G protein-coupled receptors. These receptors are expressed in a wide range of cell types, including distinct neuronal populations, and promote diverse functional responses in multiple organ systems. These receptors are important for mediating the in vivo effects of their cognate neurotransmitter, serotonin, as well as the endogenous tryptamines. In addition, the actions of many drugs are mediated, either directly or indirectly, through serotonin receptors, including antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, sleep aids, migraine therapies, gastrointestinal therapeutics and hallucinogenic drugs. It is becoming increasingly evident that serotonin receptors can engage in differential signaling that is determined by the chemical nature of the ligand and that ligands that demonstrate a predilection for inducing a particular signaling cascade are considered to have \"functional selectivity\". The elucidation of the cellular signaling pathways that mediate the physiological responses to serotonin and other agonists is an active area of investigation and will be an onward-looking focal point for determining how to effectively and selectively promote beneficial serotonergic mimicry while avoiding unwanted clinical side effects. This review highlights the modulation of serotonin 2A, 2C, and four receptors by β-arrestins, which may represent a fulcrum for biasing receptor responsiveness in vivo.\n",

      "PMID:  17390743\n",
      "Abs: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a hereditary systemic arteriopathy presenting with migraines, mood disorders, focal neurologic deficits, recurrent ischemic attacks and dementia in young adults. The genesis of this disease relates to missense mutation of the Notch3 gene. We report here a newly identified CADASIL patient and discuss unique vascular lesions observed in the kidney. A 64-year-old female was admitted to our hospital for the investigation of proteinuria, hematuria and progressive neurological abnormalities. Her mother and brother died of cerebral infarction at a relatively young age despite a lack of apparent risk factors for arteriosclerosis. Over the past 4 months before admission, she had suffered from frequent transient ischemic attacks despite appropriate antiplatelet therapy. Blood examination revealed mild renal insufficiency and urinalysis revealed moderate protein excretion and dysmorphic hematuria. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed multiple infarcts and leukoencephalopathy. Histopathological analysis of the kidney revealed focal segmental mesangial proliferation, the loss and degeneration of arterial medial smooth muscle cells and arterial intimal thickening. Immunofluorescence analysis of glomeruli revealed IgA deposition in the mesangial area. Electron microscope analysis revealed electron-dense deposition also in the mesangial area. In addition, granular osmophilic material (GOM) was observed in the extraglomerular mesangial area and around the vascular smooth muscle cells. Genetic analysis of Notch3 revealed an R141C missense mutation and she was diagnosed with CADASIL complicated with IgA nephropathy. In immunohistological analysis, Notch3 stains were positive in vascular smooth muscle cells of the interlobular arteries and both afferent and efferent arterioles, and weak in the glomerular mesangial area. Antihypertensive treatment using angiotensin II receptor blocker and a low protein diet were initiated, and her urinary protein excretion decreased to 0.2 g/day. However, due to the progression of her neurological abnormalities, she became socially withdrawn. In CADASIL, GOM, abnormal accumulation of Notch3 ectodomain, is thought to induce the degeneration and loss of vascular smooth muscle cells and subsequent intimal thickening. Analysis of our cases provided that these morphological abnormalities were also observed in the CADASIL patient kidney.\n",

      "PMID:  25420561\n",
      "Abs: A 14-year-old girl was referred to us with severe migraine-like headaches associated with vomiting and right homonymous hemianopsia. On admission, MRI examination showed high signals in the left occipital cortex and subcortex on T2-weighted images, without reduction of apparent diffusion coefficient suggestive of cerebral infarction. Her EEG demonstrated periodic sharp waves in the left posterior region, and laboratory tests revealed she had increased levels of lactic and pyruvic acid both in blood plasma and CSF. Gene analysis confirmed mitochondrial DNA A3243G mutation. Based on this data, we diagnosed her as having mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and a stroke-like episode (MELAS). L-arginine infusion was unsuccessful for her severe headaches, which remained prolonged. She received a low dose (0.05 mg/kg/h) midazolam infusion, resulting in immediate improvement and the disappearance of headaches and abnormal EEG findings. By the age of 18, she had been readmitted eight times for stroke-like episodes accompanied by headaches. While L-arginine infusions alleviated her headaches when administered on day 1 of her episodes, they were not effective when started on or after day 2. Her L-arginine-resistant headaches were relieved by midazolam. Although the pathogenesis of headaches in MELAS is still unknown, neuronal hyperexcitability and trigeminovascular activation are considered important. Midazolam may play a role in suppressing neuronal hyperexcitability and trigeminovascular activation. Treatment with midazolam is advisable for headaches in patients with MELAS, in the event that L-arginine therapy is unsuccessful.\n",

      "Abs: INTRODUCTION: Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) is a mitochondrial syndrome on a disease spectrum with Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS). Clinical presentation is variable and our experience suggested that phenotypic differences exist in CPEO with onset after age 20. METHODS: This descriptive study is a retrospective chart review of 40 patients with late-onset CPEO. Clinical features, laboratory and neurophysiology results were reviewed. RESULTS: Multisystem dysfunction was very common in this series. Gastrointestinal dysfunction was more common than expected (60%) as was migraine headache (40%). Clinical characteristics on the KSS disease spectrum were uncommon in this series with only 2.5% having pigmentary retinopathy, 5% with cardiac conduction abnormality, and 22.5% having endocrinopathy (most often thyroid dysfunction rather than diabetes). Neurophysiology abnormalities included length-dependent axonal polyneuropathy in 44% (sometimes subclinical) and myopathic EMG changes in 26%. Exposure to sources of acquired mitochondrial toxicity including cigarette use and hepatitis C infection were more common than expected in this series. DISCUSSION: Phenotype was different in this late-onset series compared with previous reports in CPEO patients. In this series of late-onset patients, multi-organ dysfunction was more common than previously reported in CPEO, and some classical mitochondrial manifestations, such as pigmentary retinopathy were rare. We suggest that acquired mitochondrial toxicity may have a role in the pathogenesis of adult-onset CPEO.\n",

      "PMID:  20587104\n",
      "Abs: This paper reviews the history of aerosol therapy; discusses patient, drug, and device factors that can influence the success of aerosol therapy; and identifies trends that will drive the science of aerosol therapy in the future. Aerosol medication is generally less expensive, works more rapidly, and produces fewer side effects than the same drug given systemically. Aerosol therapy has been used for thousands of years by steaming and burning plant material. In the 50 years since the invention of the pressurized metered-dose inhaler, advances in drugs and devices have made aerosols the most commonly used way to deliver therapy for asthma and COPD. The requirements for aerosol therapy depend on the target site of action and the underlying disease. Medication to treat airways disease should deposit on the conducting airways. Effective deposition of airway particles generally requires particle size between 0.5 and 5 microm mass median aerodynamic diameter; however, a smaller particle size neither equates to greater side effects nor greater effectiveness. However, medications like peptides intended for systemic absorption, need to deposit on the alveolar capillary bed. Thus ultrafine particles, a slow inhalation, and relatively normal airways that do not hinder aerosol penetration will optimize systemic delivery. Aerosolized antimicrobials are often used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis, and mucoactive agents to promote mucus clearance have been delivered by aerosol. As technology improves, a greater variety of novel medications are being developed for aerosol delivery, including for therapy of pulmonary hypertension, as vaccines, for decreasing dyspnea, to treat airway inflammation, for migraine headache, for nicotine and drug addiction, and ultimately for gene therapy. Common reasons for therapeutic failure of aerosol medications include the use of inactive or depleted medications, inappropriate use of the aerosol device, and, most importantly, poor adherence to prescribed therapy. The respiratory therapist plays a key role in patient education, device selection, and outcomes assessment.\n",

      "PMID:  20876488\n",
      "Abs: Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) syndrome is the most common monogenic inherited form of small vessel disease, characterized by frequent migraine attacks with aura, recurrent strokes and progressive white matter degeneration. Early vascular cognitive impairment progresses into frank dementia of subcortical type later in life. Linked to mutations in the NOTCH3 gene, CADASIL vasculopathy is associated with accumulation of granular osmiophilic material and NOTCH3 extracellular domain around small caliber arteries and arterioles, and eventual loss of vascular smooth muscle cells. Cerebral blood flow dysregulation has been hypothesized as a major mechanism, largely based on evidence from hemodynamic studies in CADASIL patients. Although animal models expressing CADASIL mutations reproduced the pathology and cerebrovascular dysfunction, the phenotypic spectrum has been quite heterogeneous, possibly due to the choice of genetic constructs and obvious species differences between mouse and man. Nevertheless, these experimental models provide new opportunities to explore the molecular and physiological mechanisms of CADASIL, and address the fundamental question of whether CADASIL phenotype represents loss of NOTCH3 function or gain of a novel and pathological function. Here, I provide an overview of existing animal models of CADASIL and the pathophysiological insights gained from these models.\n",

      "PMID:  18651939\n",
      "Abs: Cluster headache (CH) is a primary headache disease characterized by recurrent short-lasting attacks (15 to 180 minutes) of excruciating unilateral periorbital pain accompanied by ipsilateral autonomic signs (lacrimation, nasal congestion, ptosis, miosis, lid edema, redness of the eye). It affects young adults, predominantly males. Prevalence is estimated at 0.5-1.0/1,000. CH has a circannual and circadian periodicity, attacks being clustered (hence the name) in bouts that can occur during specific months of the year. Alcohol is the only dietary trigger of CH, strong odors (mainly solvents and cigarette smoke) and napping may also trigger CH attacks. During bouts, attacks may happen at precise hours, especially during the night. During the attacks, patients tend to be restless. CH may be episodic or chronic, depending on the presence of remission periods. CH is associated with trigeminovascular activation and neuroendocrine and vegetative disturbances, however, the precise cautive mechanisms remain unknown. Involvement of the hypothalamus (a structure regulating endocrine function and sleep-wake rhythms) has been confirmed, explaining, at least in part, the cyclic aspects of CH. The disease is familial in about 10% of cases. Genetic factors play a role in CH susceptibility, and a causative role has been suggested for the hypocretin receptor gene. Diagnosis is clinical. Differential diagnoses include other primary headache diseases such as migraine, paroxysmal hemicrania and SUNCT syndrome. At present, there is no curative treatment. There are efficient treatments to shorten the painful attacks (acute treatments) and to reduce the number of daily attacks (prophylactic treatments). Acute treatment is based on subcutaneous administration of sumatriptan and high-flow oxygen. Verapamil, lithium, methysergide, prednisone, greater occipital nerve blocks and topiramate may be used for prophylaxis. In refractory cases, deep-brain stimulation of the hypothalamus and greater occipital nerve stimulators have been tried in experimental settings. The disease course over a lifetime is unpredictable. Some patients have only one period of attacks, while in others the disease evolves from episodic to chronic form.\n",

      "PMID:  18220816\n",
      "Abs: Based on the painful effects of exposure to capsaicin, TRPV1 (transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 1) localization is most readily associated with peripheral sensory neurons, however, TRPV1 is now known to be expressed, albeit at lower levels, in the spinal cord, brain and a wide-range of non-neuronal cells. The latter includes epithelial cells (e.g. keratinocytes, urothelium, gastric epithelial cells, enterocytes, and pneumocytes) through vascular endothelium and cells of the immune system (e.g. T-cells and mast cells) to smooth muscle, fibroblasts and hepatocytes. Despite extensive research, the physiological function of TRPV1 in the brain and in non-neuronal tissues remains elusive. The preliminary results are exciting, but many are unconfirmed and/or contradictory. As yet, studies with TRPV1 knock-out mice have proven unhelpful in clarifying such biological roles. Now that a range of potent and selective TRPV1 antagonists are available in this rapidly expanding research field, further understanding of the biological roles of TRPV1 throughout the body is within reach. In this article, we will summarize the known roles of peripheral TRPV1 receptors in physiology and disease and review the current perspectives for the therapeutic potential of TRPV1 agonists and antagonists in the treatment of a wide range of conditions such as pain, cancer, migraine, chronic cough, asthma, rectal hypersensitivity, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, overactive bladder and diabetes. New applications of targeting central TRPV1 receptors are reviewed in the accompanying article by Starowicz et al. (in this issue).\n",

      "PMID:  12349912\n",
      "Abs: The effects of 5-hydroxytriptamine (5-HT, serotonin) are mediated via five main receptor types of which the 5-HT7 receptor is the most recently characterised member. The 5-HT7 receptor has been shown to participate in mediating cranial blood vessels dilatation that may result in migraine headache. We report here the cDNA cloning, sequencing and tissue distribution of porcine 5-HT7 receptor and illustrate its comparison with corresponding receptor of known species. Employing a combination of reverse transcriptase and inverse polymerase chain reaction we amplified and sequenced a full length cDNA from the porcine cerebral cortex. The deduced amino acid sequence comparison confirmed that the cloned porcine receptor belongs to 5-HT7 receptor as described for human and other species and showing overall homology of 92-96%. The expression of 5-HT7 receptor mRNA was observed in porcine central (cerebral cortex, trigeminal ganglion and cerebellum) as well as in peripheral (pulmonary and coronary arteries, superior vena cava and saphenous vein) tissues. The established cDNA sequence and tissue distribution of porcine 5-HT7 receptor will be helpful in exploring the role of this receptor in pathophysiological processes and to predict as a potential therapeutic target for antimigraine drug development.\n",

      "PMID:  10641955\n",
      "Abs: Corticosteroids (glucocorticoids), used frequently as potent anti-inflammatory agents, increase the risk of glaucoma by raising the intraocular pressure (IOP) when administered exogenously (topically, periocularly or systemically) and in certain conditions of increased endogenous production (e.g. Cushing's syndrome). Approximately 18 to 36% of the general population are corticosteroid responders. This response is increased to 46 to 92% in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Patients over 40 years of age and with certain systemic diseases (e.g. diabetes mellitus, high myopia) as well as relatives of patients with POAG are more vulnerable to corticosteroid-induced glaucoma. The association of corticosteroid-induced ocular hypertension in other conditions which are considered as risk factors for glaucoma (racial origins, hypertension, migraine, vasospasm) is likely but not fully established. The proposed mechanism of corticosteroid-induced glaucoma includes morphological and functional changes in the trabecular meshwork system and is similar to the pathogenesis of POAG. Trabecular cells exposed to corticosteroids in vitro show endoreplication of nuclei, an increase in cell size and excessive production of an approximately 56kD glycoprotein, identified as myocilin and transcribed by the GLC1A gene. Induction of ocular hypertension after corticosteroid administration depends on the specific drug, the dose, the frequency of administration and the corticosteroid responsiveness of the patient. The risk of corticosteroid-induced glaucoma can be minimised with judicious use of corticosteroids, as well as education of patients and medical practitioners. New treatment modalities include modified steroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents that will have less effect on the elevation of IOP.\n",

      "PMID:  30979812\n",
      "Abs: Cloxyquin has been reported as a specific activator of TRESK [TWIK-related spinal cord K(+) channel (also known as K(2P)18.1)] background potassium channel. In this study, we have synthetized chemically modified analogs of cloxyquin and tested their effects on TRESK and other K(2P) channels. The currents of murine K(2P) channels, expressed heterologously in Xenopus oocytes, were measured by two-electrode voltage clamp, whereas the native background K(+) conductance of mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons was examined by the whole-cell patch-clamp method. Some of the analogs retained the activator character of the parent compound, but, more interestingly, other derivatives inhibited mouse TRESK current. The inhibitor analogs (A2764 and A2793) exerted state-dependent effects. The degree of inhibition by 100 µM A2764 (77.8% ± 3.5%, n = 6) was larger in the activated state of TRESK (i.e., after calcineurin-dependent stimulation) than in the resting state of the channel (42.8% ± 11.5% inhibition, n = 7). The selectivity of the inhibitor compounds was tested on several K(2P) channels. A2793 inhibited TWIK-related acid-sensitive K(+) channel (TASK)-1 (100 µM, 53.4% ± 13, 5%, n = 5), while A2764 was more selective for TRESK, it only moderately influenced TREK-1 and TWIK-related alkaline pH-activated K(+) channel. The effect of A2764 was also examined on the background K(+) currents of DRG neurons. A subpopulation of DRG neurons, prepared from wild-type animals, expressed background K(+) currents sensitive to A2764, whereas the inhibitor did not affect the currents in the DRG neurons of TRESK-deficient mice. Accordingly, A2764 may prove to be useful for the identification of TRESK current in native cells, and for the investigation of the role of the channel in nociception and migraine. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: TRESK background potassium channel is a potential pharmacological target in migraine and neuropathic pain. In this study, we have identified a selective inhibitor of TRESK, A2764. This compound can inhibit TRESK in native cells, leading to cell depolarization and increased excitability. This new inhibitor may be of use to probe the role of TRESK channel in migraine and nociception.CI - Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.\n",

      "PMID:  23077215\n",
      "Abs: Functional loss of SMN1 causes proximal spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the most common genetic condition accounting for infant lethality. Hence, the hypomorphic copy gene SMN2 is the only resource of functional SMN protein in SMA patients and influences SMA severity in a dose-dependent manner. Consequently, current therapeutic approaches focus on SMN2. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), such as the short chain fatty acid VPA (valproic acid), ameliorate the SMA phenotype by activating the SMN2 expression. By analyzing blood SMN2 expression in 16 VPA-treated SMA patients, about one-third of individuals were identified as positive responders presenting increased SMN2 transcript levels. In 66% of enrolled patients, a concordant response was detected in the respective fibroblasts. Most importantly, by taking the detour of reprograming SMA patients' fibroblasts, we showed that the VPA response was maintained even in GABAergic neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) cells. Differential expression microarray analysis revealed a complete lack of response to VPA in non-responders, which was associated with an increased expression of the fatty acid translocase CD36. The pivotal role of CD36 as the cause of non-responsiveness was proven in various in vitro approaches. Most importantly, knockdown of CD36 in SMA fibroblasts converted non- into pos-responders. In summary, the concordant response from blood to the central nervous system (CNS) to VPA may allow selection of pos-responders prior to therapy. Increased CD36 expression accounts for VPA non-responsiveness. These findings may be essential not only for SMA but also for other diseases such as epilepsy or migraine frequently treated with VPA.\n",

      "PMID:  22315449\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a neuropeptide with multiple neuroendocrine roles, including vasodilation, migraine, and pain. The receptor for CGRP is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that requires three proteins for function. CGRP binds to a heterodimer composed of the GPCR calcitonin-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity-modifying protein (RAMP1), a single transmembrane protein required for pharmacological specificity and trafficking of the CLR/RAMP1 complex to the cell surface. In addition, the CLR/RAMP1 complex requires a third protein named CGRP-receptor component protein (RCP) for signaling. Previous studies have demonstrated that depletion of RCP from cells inhibits CLR signaling, and in vivo studies have demonstrated that expression of RCP correlates with CLR signaling and CGRP efficacy. It is not known whether RCP interacts directly with CLR to exert its effect. The current studies identified a direct interaction between RCP and an intracellular domain of CLR using yeast two-hybrid analysis and coimmunoprecipitation. When this interacting domain of CLR was expressed as a soluble fusion protein, it coimmunoprecipitated with RCP and inhibited signaling from endogenous CLR. Expression of this dominant-negative domain of CLR did not significantly inhibit trafficking of CLR to the cell surface, and thus RCP may not have a chaperone function for CLR. Instead, RCP may regulate CLR signaling in the cell membrane, and direct interaction between RCP and CLR is required for CLR activation. To date, RCP has been found to interact only with CLR and represents a novel neuroendocrine regulatory step in GPCR signaling.\n",

      "PMID:  16636648\n",
      "Abs: PURPOSE: The electrogenic Na+/HCO3- cotransporter (NBCe1) plays a major role in renal bicarbonate absorption via proximal tubules and therefore is crucial for maintaining normal blood pH. The human gene for NBCe1 (SLC4A4) produces two major transcripts by alternative promoter usage (kNBCe1, originally cloned from kidney and pNBCe1, pancreatic/general form). Though rare, recessive SLC4A4 mutations have been reported in patients with proximal renal tubular acidosis, short stature, and ocular pathology. A 27-year-old male presented with these findings. The purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular pathology responsible for this patient's clinical findings. METHODS: A comprehensive ophthalmic examination was performed, detailed ocular and systemic medical histories were taken and past medical records were obtained. Mutation screening was performed by using direct PCR sequencing of SLC4A4 exons and flanking intronic regions. Functional characterization of the mutation was made by expressing the wild-type and mutant NBCe1 proteins in Xenopus oocytes. RESULTS: We identified a novel, homozygous, missense SLC4A4 mutation (Leu522Pro in kNBCe1) in our patient who had pRTA, short stature, enamel hypoplasia, and bilateral ocular disease (cataract, glaucoma, and band keratopathy). The patient also had a medical history of ataxia, migraine with transient hemiparesis attacks, and slight hypothyroidism. The mutant RNA failed to induce electrogenic transport activity. The L522P-protein was not effectively transported to the oocyte membrane and thus was unable to act as a transmembrane transporter. CONCLUSIONS: This novel mutation increases our understanding of the structural/functional aspects of the NBCe1 protein and the molecular basis of the multiorgan pathologies associated with its defects.\n",

      "PMID:  22586115\n",
      "Abs: Peptide hormones and neuropeptides have important roles in physiology and therefore the regulation of these bioactive peptides is of great interest. In some cases proteolysis controls the concentrations and signaling of bioactive peptides, and the peptidases that mediate this biochemistry have proven to be extremely successful drug targets. Due to the lack of any general method to identify these peptidases, however, the role of proteolysis in the regulation of most neuropeptides and peptide hormones is unknown. This limitation prompted us to develop an advanced peptidomics-based strategy to identify the peptidases responsible for the proteolysis of significant bioactive peptides. The application of this approach to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neuropeptide associated with blood pressure and migraine, revealed the endogenous CGRP cleavage sites. This information was then used to biochemically purify the peptidase capable of proteolysis of CGRP at those cleavage sites, which led to the identification of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) as a candidate CGRP-degrading enzyme. CGRP had not been identified as an IDE substrate before and we tested the physiological relevance of this interaction by quantitative measurements of CGRP using IDE null (IDE(-/-)) mice. In the absence of IDE, full-length CGRP levels are elevated in vivo, confirming IDE as an endogenous CGRP-degrading enzyme. By linking CGRP and IDE, this strategy uncovers a previously unknown pathway for CGRP regulation and characterizes an additional role for IDE. More generally, this work suggests that this may be an effective general strategy for characterizing these pathways and peptidases moving forward.\n",

      "PMID:  20975053\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays a fundamental role in the pathophysiology of neurovascular headaches. CGRP infusion causes headache and dilation of cranial vessels. However, it is unknown to what extent CGRP-induced vasodilation contributes to immediate head pain and whether the migraine-specific abortive drug sumatriptan, a 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B/1D agonist, inhibits CGRP-induced immediate vasodilation and headache. METHODS: We performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers. We recorded circumference changes of the middle meningeal artery (MMA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) using magnetic resonance angiography before and after infusion (20 minutes) of 1.5 μg/min human αCGRP or placebo (isotonic saline) as well as after a 6-mg sumatriptan subcutaneous injection. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, CGRP caused significant dilation of MMA (p = 0.006) and no dilation of MCA (p = 0.69). Sumatriptan caused a marked contraction of MMA (15%-25.2%) and marginal contraction of MCA (3.9% to 5.3%). Explorative analysis revealed that sumatriptan had a more selective action on MMA compared with MCA on the CGRP day (p < 0.0001) and on the placebo day (p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that exogenous CGRP dilates extracranial vessels and not intracranial, and that sumatriptan exerts part of its antinociceptive action by constricting MMA and not MCA. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class I evidence that IV GCRP causes dilation of the MMA but not the MCA in healthy volunteers, and that sumatriptan reverses the dilation of the MMA caused by CGRP.\n",

      "Abs: Large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (BK(ca)) are crucial for the regulation of cerebral vascular basal tone and might be involved in cerebral vasodilation relevant to migraine and stroke. We studied the differential gene expression of mRNA transcript levels and protein expression of the BK(Ca) channel in rat basilar, middle cerebral, and middle meningeal arteries by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), quantitative real-time PCR, and Western blotting. Distribution patterns were investigated using in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence studies. RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR detected the expression of the BK(Ca) channel mRNA transcript in rat basilar, middle cerebral, and middle meningeal arteries, with the transcript being expressed more abundantly in rat basilar arteries than in middle cerebral and middle meningeal arteries. Western blotting detected the BK(Ca) channel protein in rat basilar and middle cerebral arteries. In situ hybridization and immunofluorescence studies confirmed that the BK(Ca) channel mRNA and protein expression was localized to smooth muscle cells in all three intracranial arteries. The data thus suggest the presence and localization of both mRNA and protein expression of the BK(Ca) channel in the smooth muscle cell layer in rat basilar, middle cerebral, and middle meningeal arteries.\n",

      "Abs: In this study, we investigated the effect of alpha-eudesmol, which potently inhibits the presynaptic omega-agatoxin IVA-sensitive (P/Q-type) Ca(2+) channel, on neurogenic inflammation following electrical stimulation of rat trigeminal ganglion. Treatment with alpha-eudesmol (0.1-1 mg/kg. i.v.) dose-dependently attenuated neurogenic vasodilation in facial skin monitored by a laser Doppler flowmetry. In addition, alpha-eudesmol (1 mg/kg. i.v.) significantly decreased dural plasma extravasation in analysis using Evans blue as a plasma marker. On the other hand, alpha-eudesmol (1 mg/kg, i.v.) did not affect mean arterial blood pressure in rats. The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP) released from activated sensory nerves have recently been suggested to be associated with the neurogenic inflammation. In this study, we also showed that alpha-eudesmol (0.45-45 microM) concentration-dependently inhibits the depolarization-evoked CGRP and SP release from sensory nerve terminals in spinal cord slices. These results indicate that the anti-neurogenic inflammation action of alpha-eudesmol, which does not affect the cardiovascular system, may be due to its presynaptic inhibition of the neuropeptide release from perivascular trigeminal terminals. We also suggest that the omega-agatoxin IVA-sensitive Ca(2+) channel blocker, alpha-eudesmol, may become useful for the treatment of the neurogenic inflammation in the trigemino-vascular system such as migraine.\n",

      "PMID:  16808996\n",
      "Abs: Activation of the trigeminovascular pain signalling system appears involved in migraine pathophysiology. However, the molecular mechanisms are only partially known. Stimulation of cAMP and cGMP production as well as inhibition of their breakdown induce migraine-like headache. Additionally, migraine may be associated with mutations in ion channels. The aim of the present study was to describe the expression of phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) and 5 (PDE5) and cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (CNG) in cerebral arteries, meninges, and the trigeminal ganglion. mRNA for PDE and CNG was determined in the rat middle cerebral artery, basilar artery, trigeminal ganglion, and dura mater using real-time PCR. PDE and CNG proteins were identified using Western blot. For comparison, rat aorta and mesenteric artery were analysed. PDE3A, PDE3B, and PDE5A mRNA were detected in all tissues examined except for PDE3A mRNA in dura mater and the trigeminal ganglion. PDE5A and PDE3A protein expression was present in both cerebral and peripheral arteries, whereas PDE3B protein was present only in the cerebral arteries. The CNGA4 and B1 subunit mRNAs were detected in cerebral arteries and CNGA2 also in the mesenteric artery. CNGA2 and A3 proteins were found in cerebral arteries and dura and CNGA1, CNGA2 and CNGA3 in the trigeminal ganglion. In conclusion, PDE3A, PDE3B, PDE5A, and five CNG subunits were expressed in several components of the trigeminovascular system of the rat. This suggests that modulation of cAMP and cGMP levels by PDE and activation of CNG may play a role in trigeminovascular pain signalling leading to migraine headache.\n",

      "Abs: 1-Piperidinecarboxamide, N-[2-[[5-amino-l-[[4-(4-pyridinyl)-l-piperazinyl]carbonyl]pentyl]amino]-1-[(3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxyphenyl)methyl]-2-oxoethyl]-4-(1,4-dihydro-2-oxo-3(2H)-quinazolinyl) (BIBN4096BS), a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, can alleviate the symptoms of migraine and is highly selective for CGRP over adrenomedullin (AM) receptors. These receptors are heterodimers of the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CL) and receptor activity modifying proteins (RAMPs), with the pharmacological properties determined by the RAMP subunit. BIBN4096BS-sensitive CGRP(1) receptors are CL/RAMP1, whereas BIBN4096BS-insensitive AM receptors are CL/RAMP2 or CL/RAMP3 (AM(1) and AM(2), respectively), implicating RAMP1 in conferring BIB-N4096BS sensitivity. Because calcitonin receptors [CT((a))] also interact with RAMP1 [AMY(1(a)) receptors], BIBN4096BS could also have affinity for these receptors. To test this, receptors were transfected into COS-7 cells and agonist-stimulated cAMP levels measured in the presence and absence of antagonists. We found that AMY(1(a)) receptors were approximately 150-fold less sensitive to BIBN4096BS antagonism than CGRP(1) receptors. In contrast, AMY(3(a)) [CT((a))/RAMP3] or AM(2) receptors were not sensitive to BIBN4096BS antagonism. We investigated Trp74 in RAMP1, a residue implicated in the species selectivity of BIBN4096BS. BIBN4096BS affinity was reduced at AMY(1(a)) and CGRP(1) receptors when this residue was mutated to lysine or alanine. The equivalent residue in RAMP3, Glu74, when mutated to tryptophan (E74W), induced BIBN4096BS sensitivity at AM(2) and AMY(3(a)) receptors. It is interesting that a selective reduction in AM potency was observed at E74W AM(2) receptors, implicating this residue in AM interactions with this receptor. These data support the importance of Trp74 in RAMP1 in the interaction of BIBN4096BS with CGRP(1) and AMY(1(a)) receptors and identified Glu74 in RAMP3 as the first amino acid in RAMP important for agonist interactions with calcitonin-family receptors.\n",

      "PMID:  24667981\n",
      "Abs: Large conductance, calcium-activated potassium channels [big potassium (BK) channel] consist of a tetramer of pore-forming α-subunit and distinct accessory β-subunits (β1-4) that modify the channel's properties. In this study, we analyzed the effects of BK channel activators and blockers on glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release from synaptosomes isolated from the cerebral cortices or trigeminal caudal nuclei (TCN) of rats. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to characterize BK channel α and β(1-4) subunit expression in the cortex and in the trigeminal ganglia (TG), whose neurons project primary terminal afferents into the TCN. Immunocytochemistry was used to localize these subunits on cortical and TCN synaptosomes. The BK channels regulating [(3)H]D-aspartate release from primary afferent nerve terminals projecting into the TCN displayed limited sensitivity to iberiotoxin, whereas those expressed on cortical synaptosomes were highly sensitive to this toxin. BK channels did not appear to be present on GABAergic nerve terminals from the TCN since [(3)H]-γ-aminobutyric acid release in this model was unaffected by BK channel activators or blockers. Gene expression studies revealed expression levels of the α subunit in the TG that were only 31.2 ± 2.1% of those found in cortical tissues. The β4 subunit was the accessory subunit expressed most abundantly in both the cortex and TG. Levels of β1 and β2 were low in both these areas although β2 expression in the TG was higher than that found in the cortex. Immunocytochemistry experiments showed that co-localization of α and β4 subunits (the accessory subunit most abundantly expressed in both brain areas) was more common in TCN synaptosomes than in cortical synaptosomes. On the basis of these findings, it is reasonable to hypothesize that BK channels expressed on glutamatergic terminals in the TCN and cortex have distinct pharmacological profiles, which probably reflect different α and β subunit combinations. Channels in the cortex seem to be composed mainly of α subunits and to a lesser degree by α and β4 subunits, whereas in the TG the α + β4 combination seems to prevail (although α and/or α + β2 channels cannot be excluded). In light of the BK channels' selective control of excitatory transmission and their pharmacological diversity, their effects on primary glutamatergic afferents projecting to TCN represent a potential target for drug therapy of migraines and other types of orofacial pain.\n",

      "PMID:  31917787\n",
      "Abs: Genome-wide association studies have identified multiple novel genomic loci associated with vascular diseases. Many of these loci are common non-coding variants that affect the expression of disease-relevant genes within coronary vascular cells. To identify such genes on a genome-wide level, we performed deep transcriptomic analysis of genotyped primary human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMCs) and coronary endothelial cells (HCAECs) from the same subjects, including splicing Quantitative Trait Loci (sQTL), allele-specific expression (ASE), and colocalization analyses. We identified sQTLs for TARS2, YAP1, CFDP1, and STAT6 in HCASMCs and HCAECs, and 233 ASE genes, a subset of which are also GTEx eGenes in arterial tissues. Colocalization of GWAS association signals for coronary artery disease (CAD), migraine, stroke and abdominal aortic aneurysm with GTEx eGenes in aorta, coronary artery and tibial artery discovered novel candidate risk genes for these diseases. At the CAD and stroke locus tagged by rs2107595 we demonstrate colocalization with expression of the proximal gene TWIST1. We show that disrupting the rs2107595 locus alters TWIST1 expression and that the risk allele has increased binding of the NOTCH signaling protein RBPJ. Finally, we provide data that TWIST1 expression influences vascular SMC phenotypes, including proliferation and calcification, as a potential mechanism supporting a role for TWIST1 in CAD.\n",

      "PMID:  26104464\n",
      "Abs: Mutations in POLG are increasingly recognized as a cause of refractory occipital lobe epilepsy (OLE) and status epilepticus (SE). Our aim was to describe the epilepsy syndrome in seven patients with POLG mutations. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of seven patients with POLG mutations and epilepsy. Mutation analysis was performed by direct sequencing of the coding exons of the POLG gene. Disease onset was at a median age of 18 years (range 12-26). Epilepsy was the presenting problem in six patients. All had focal seizures, with motor (n = 6) and visual (n = 6) phenomena. Six patients had secondarily generalized seizures and two patients had myoclonic seizures. Six patients had one or more episodes of refractory SE, including focal (n = 5), subtle (n = 4), myoclonic (n = 2) and convulsive (n = 3) SE. During or after SE, brain MRI showed lesions affecting the occipital lobe in all patients, probably due to continuous epileptic activity. Five of the six patients with SE died during treatment of SE, one due to valproate-induced hepatotoxicity. Associated clinical symptoms were ataxia (n = 6), polyneuropathy (n = 6), progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) (n = 3) and migraine (n = 3). Epilepsy may be the first and dominant neurological problem caused by POLG mutations. The epilepsy may be severe and the condition of the patient may end in fatal SE. Refractory OLE and SE in a patient with polyneuropathy, ataxia, PEO or migraine warrant screening for POLG mutations. In this clinical setting, valproate should not be given in view of the risk of fatal hepatotoxicity.\n",

      "Abs: The serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT(7) receptors are expressed in both the central nervous system and in peripheral tissues. Receptor distribution studies and pharmacological studies have established that 5-HT(7) receptors play an important role in the control of circadian rhythms and thermoregulation. Selective 5-HT(7) receptor ligands have potential therapeutic applications for the treatment of pain and migraine, schizophrenia, anxiety, cognitive disturbances and inflammation. We have cloned two novel C-terminal splice variants of the 5-HT(7) receptor from mouse brain. These two new splice variants have almost identical sequences as the rat 5-HT(7(b)) and 5-HT(7(c)) splice variants and so were given the same name. Ligand binding assays ([(3)H]5-CT), membrane localization and functional studies in transiently transfected cells indicated that all three splice variants are well expressed on the membrane and no major differences in their respective pharmacology and their ability to activate adenylyl cyclase were observed. This is in analogy with previous reports comparing either the rat or the human variants.\n",

      "Abs: Receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) are single pass membrane proteins initially identified by their ability to determine the pharmacology of the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR), a family B G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). It is now known that RAMPs can interact with a much wider range of GPCRs. This review considers recent developments on the structure of the complexes formed between the extracellular domains (ECDs) of CLR and RAMP1 or RAMP2 as these provide insights as to how the RAMPs direct ligand binding. The range of RAMP interactions is also considered; RAMPs can interact with numerous family B GPCRs as well as examples of family A and family C GPCRs. They influence receptor expression at the cell surface, trafficking, ligand binding and G protein coupling. The GPCR-RAMP interface offers opportunities for drug targeting, illustrated by examples of drugs developed for migraine.CI - © 2016 Authors; published by Portland Press Limited.\n",

      "Title: Delayed upregulation of ATP P2X3 receptors of trigeminal sensory neurons by calcitonin gene-related peptide\n",
      "PMID:  16763024\n",
      "Abs: Recent evidence indicates a key role for the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in migraine pain, as demonstrated by the strong analgesic action of CGRP receptor antagonists, although the mechanisms of this effect remain unclear. Most trigeminal nociceptive neurons releasing CGRP also express ATP-activated purinergic P2X3 receptors to transduce pain. To understand whether the CGRP action involves P2X3 receptor modulation, the model of trigeminal nociceptive neurons in culture was used to examine the long-term action of this peptide. Although 79% of CGRP-binding neurons expressed P2X3 receptors, acute application of CGRP did not change P2X3 receptor function. Nevertheless, after 1 h of CGRP treatment, strong enhancement of the amplitude of P2X3 receptor currents was observed together with accelerated recovery from desensitization. Receptor upregulation persisted up to 10 h (despite CGRP washout), was accompanied by increased P2X3 gene transcription, and was fully prevented by the CGRP antagonist CGRP(8-37). Surface biotinylation showed CGRP augmented P2X3 receptor expression, consistent with confocal microscopy data indicating enhanced P2X3 immunoreactivity beneath the neuronal membrane. These results suggest that CGRP stimulated trafficking of P2X3 receptors to the cell-surface membrane. Using pharmacological tools, we demonstrated that this effect of CGRP was dependent on protein kinase A and PKC activation and was prevented by the trafficking inhibitor brefeldin A. Capsaicin-sensitive TRPV1 vanilloid receptors were not upregulated. The present data demonstrate a new form of selective, slow upregulation of nociceptive P2X3 receptors on trigeminal neurons by CGRP. This mechanism might contribute to pain sensitization and represents a model of neuronal plasticity in response to a migraine mediator.\n",

      "PMID:  16873605\n",
      "Abs: Human alpha-calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a 37-residue neuropeptide that produces a variety of cardiovascular and other effects via activation of specific CGRP receptors that produce cAMP. Functional CGRP receptors are a heterodimeric complex composed of the heptahelical calcitonin receptor-like receptor and the single transmembrane receptor activity-modifying protein 1. Based on the known structures of the antagonist CGRP((8-37)) and the human CGRP receptor, we designed novel CGRP receptor peptide antagonists with modifications to promote high affinity and selectivity for human CGRP receptors. Antagonist affinity (K(B)) at CGRP receptors was determined using the mouse thoracic aorta and human SK-N-MC cells. In aorta, CGRP((8-37)), [N-alpha-benzoyl]human alpha-CGRP((8-37)) [bzl-CGRP((8-37))], and [N-alpha-benzoyl-His(10)-benzyl]human alpha-CGRP((8-37)) [bzl-bn-CGRP((8-37))] caused rightward shifts in the concentration-response relaxation curve for CGRP with K(B) values of 1000, 88, and 50 nM, respectively. In human SK-N-MC cells, CGRP((8-37)), bzl-CGRP((8-37)), and bzl-bn-CGRP((8-37)) caused rightward shifts in the concentration-response curve for CGRP-stimulated cAMP production with K(B) values of 797, 15, and 0.63 nM, respectively. Thus, CGRP((8-37)) had the same affinity for human and mouse CGRP receptors, whereas bzl-CGRP((8-37)) and bzl-bn-CGRP((8-37)) displayed 6- and 80-fold higher affinities, respectively, for human CGRP receptors. In addition, the selectivity of the antagonists for human CGRP receptors was highly correlated with the antagonist hydrophobicity index. These relatively high-affinity, species-selective peptide antagonists provide novel tools to differentiate structural and functional features that are unique to the human CGRP receptor. Thus, these analogs may be useful compounds for development of drugs to treat migraine headache and other cardiovascular diseases.\n",

      "PMID:  28846462\n",
      "Abs: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common, cancer-predisposing disease caused by mutations in the NF1 tumor gene. Patients with NF1 have an increased risk for benign and malignant tumors of the nervous system (e.g., neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, gliomas) and other tissues (e.g., leukemias, rhabdomyosarcoma, etc.) as well as increased susceptibility to learning disabilities, chronic pain/migraines, hypertension, pigmentary changes, and developmental lesions (e.g., tibial pseudoarthrosis). Pigs are an attractive and upcoming animal model for future NF1 studies, but a potential limitation to porcine model research has been the lack of validated reagents for direct translational study to humans. To address that issue, we used formalin-fixed tissues (human and pigs) to evaluate select immunohistochemical markers (activated caspase-3, allograft inflammatory factor-1, beta-tubulin III, calbindin D, CD13, CD20, desmin, epithelial membrane antigen, glial fibrillary acidic protein, glucose transporter-1, laminin, myelin basic protein, myoglobin, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, S100, vimentin, and von Willebrand factor). The markers were validated by comparing known expression and localization in human and pig tissues. Validation of these markers on fixed tissues will facilitate prospective immunohistochemical studies of NF1 pigs, as well as other pig models, in a more efficient, reproducible, and translationally relevant manner.\n",

      "PMID:  11353815\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a potent vasodilator, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of migraine. Its release from adult rat trigeminal neurons in culture was shown to be markedly increased by the activation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin. Modulation of this secretion was investigated by a number of agents with known inhibitory effects on cAMP generation mediated via receptor coupling to G(i/o) proteins. Significantly, forskolin-stimulated CGRP release could be closely correlated with the phosphorylation of the protein kinase A (PKA) substrate cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Forskolin-stimulated CGRP release could be potently and effectively inhibited by the adenosine A(1) receptor-selective agonist GR79236X (pIC(50) = 7.7 +/- 0.1, maximal inhibition 65 +/- 2.5% at 300 nM), whereas the A(2A) (CGS21680) and the A(3) (2-chloro-N(6)-(3-iodobenzyl)-adenosine-5'-N-methyluronamide) receptor-selective agonists were without effect. GR79236X-mediated inhibition was abolished by the A(1) receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine. Immunocytochemical studies and Western analysis revealed the presence of adenosine A(1) receptors on trigeminal neurons. However, despite the additional detection of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1B) receptors on these cells, the clinically effective antimigraine 5-HT(1B/1D) agonist sumatriptan did not inhibit forskolin-stimulated CGRP release nor did it show any effect on the concomitant CREB phosphorylation. In contrast, the mu-opioid agonist fentanyl elicited a 74 +/- 4% reduction in CGRP levels. Forskolin-stimulated CGRP release and CREB phosphorylation could be mimicked by incubation of the cells with chlorophenylthio-cAMP and blocked by pretreatment with the PKA inhibitor myrPKI(14-22). Taken together, the present data confirm the PKA-dependence of forskolin-stimulated CGRP release and suggest that A(1) adenosine agonists may warrant further investigation in models of migraine and neurogenic inflammation.\n",

      "PMID:  22188874\n",
      "Abs: There is a pressing unmet need for long-acting and effective therapeutics to alleviate symptoms of the varied forms of chronic pain. As many sufferers do not respond satisfactorily to non-addictive anti-nociceptives, a new treatment has emerged using inhibitors for the release of pain mediators from peripheral sensory nerves to give prolonged benefit. This strategy relies on proteolytically inactivating intra-neuronal SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment protein receptors) proteins which are essential for regulated exocytosis of transmitters, peptides and other pain signalling molecules. Success has been achieved with botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) which targets neuronal acceptors via its heavy chain, becomes endocytosed and translocated into the cytosol where the long-lived protease of its light chain potently and specifically cleaves SNAP-25 (synaptosomal-associated protease of Mr=25k). Encouragingly, clinical trials have shown that local injections of BOTOX(®) (BoNT/A complex) reduce chronic migraine symptoms including frequency and intensity for many months. Several serotypes of the neurotoxin moiety alone have been prepared recombinantly using Escherichia coli, which exhibit optimal neuroparalysis. Moreover, an engineered chimera of BoNT/E in which its binding domain was replaced with that from /A efficaciously inhibits the TRPV1 (transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1)-triggered release of CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) from cultured sensory neurons, and suppresses the resultant excitatory effects in brain slices. A longer acting composite toxin, containing the protease of type E attached to BoNT/A, displays prolonged amelioration of pain symptoms in an animal model of inflammatory pain. This provides proof of principle that therapeutically advantageous features of /E (most robust inhibitor of CGRP release) and /A (targeting to sensory neurons and dramatic extension of the longevity of E protease) can be incorporated into a single synergistically active anti-nociceptive.CI - Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Title: Response properties of dural nociceptors in relation to headache\n",
      "PMID:  16492942\n",
      "Abs: Single-unit electrophysiological recording studies have examined the activity of sensory neurons in the trigeminal ganglion that innervate the intracranial meninges to better understand their possible role in headache. A key question is whether the meningeal sensory neurons are similar to nociceptive neurons in other tissues or, alternatively, whether they have unique properties that might be of significance for headache pathogenesis and drug therapy. Such studies have indeed found that the intracranial dura is innervated by neurons that exhibit properties characteristic of nociceptors in other tissues, including chemosensitivity and sensitization. This sensitization, consisting of an enhanced responsiveness to mechanical stimuli, might be relevant to symptoms that are characteristic of certain headaches that indicate the presence of an exaggerated intracranial mechanosensitivity. Studies that examined whether the anti-migraine agent sumatriptan might inhibit this sensitization (in addition to its well-known inhibition of neurotransmitter release) found that it had no inhibitory effect but rather produced a calcium-dependent discharge, which might account for the initial worsening of headache that can follow sumatriptan administration. In studies that examined the effects of vasodilator agents, nitroprusside produced mixed effects on mechanosensitivity, whereas calciton gene-related peptide (CGRP) had no effect on either spontaneous or mechanically evoked discharge. These results call into question the role of vasodilation in headache and suggest that the role of CGRP in headache may be through its action as a central neurotransmitter rather than through vasodilation and activation of meningeal nociceptors. In general, studies of meningeal sensory neurons have not found evidence of unique properties that distinguish them from nociceptive neurons in other tissues. Ultimately the distinctive clinical characteristics of headache may prove to be related not so much to any differences in the intrinsic molecular or cellular properties of the meningeal sensory neurons but rather to the distinctive properties of the tissue that they innervate.\n",

      "PMID:  20573757\n",
      "Abs: The sensory neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays a role in primary headaches, and CGRP receptor antagonists are effective in migraine treatment. CGRP is a potent vasodilator, raising the possibility that antagonism of its receptor could have cardiovascular effects. We therefore investigated the effects of the antimigraine CGRP receptor antagonist telcagepant (MK-0974) [N-[(3R,6S)-6-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-2-oxo-1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)azepan-3-yl]-4-(2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine-1-yl)piperidine-1-carboxamide] on human isolated coronary arteries. Arteries with different internal diameters were studied to assess the potential for differential effects across the coronary vascular bed. The concentration-dependent relaxation responses to human alphaCGRP were greater in distal coronary arteries (i.d. 600-1000 microm; E(max) = 83 +/- 7%) than proximal coronary arteries (i.d. 2-3 mm; E(max) = 23 +/- 9%), coronary arteries from explanted hearts (i.d. 3-5 mm; E(max) = 11 +/- 3%), and coronary arterioles (i.d. 200-300 microm; E(max) = 15 +/- 7%). Telcagepant alone did not induce contraction or relaxation of these coronary blood vessels. Pretreatment with telcagepant (10 nM to 1 microM) antagonized alphaCGRP-induced relaxation competitively in distal coronary arteries (pA(2) = 8.43 +/- 0.24) and proximal coronary arteries and coronary arterioles (1 microM telcagepant, giving pK(B) = 7.89 +/- 0.13 and 7.78 +/- 0.16, respectively). alphaCGRP significantly increased cAMP levels in distal, but not proximal, coronary arteries, and this was abolished by pretreatment with telcagepant. Immunohistochemistry revealed the expression and colocalization of the CGRP receptor elements calcitonin-like receptor and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 in the smooth muscle cells in the media layer of human coronary arteries. These findings in vitro support the cardiovascular safety of CGRP receptor antagonists and suggest that telcagepant is unlikely to induce coronary side effects under normal cardiovascular conditions.\n",

      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an inherited autosomal dominant condition characterized by migraine, recurrent stroke, and dementia. It results from mutations in the notch3 gene but mutations may occur at multiple sites making molecular diagnosis time consuming. It has been suggested that the presence of granular osmiophilic material (GOM) on skin biopsy and involvement of the anterior temporal lobe and external capsule on MRI may help in diagnosis. METHODS: The authors identified 83 potential index cases from the British population and screened exons 2 to 23 of notch3. MRI scans were scored using a modified Scheltens scale. Skin biopsy was performed in a subgroup. RESULTS: Fifteen different point mutations were identified in 48 families, 73% of which were in exon 4, 8% in exon 3, and 6% in each of exons 5 and 6. Moderate or severe involvement of the anterior temporal pole on MRI had a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 86% for diagnosis of CADASIL, whereas external capsule involvement had a high sensitivity of 93% but a low specificity of 45%. Skin biopsy, performed in 18 cases, had a sensitivity of 45% and specificity of 100%. CONCLUSIONS: The spectrum of mutations in this study can be used to plan appropriate screening protocols; a suggested protocol is to screen exon 4, and proceed to exons 3, 5, and 6 where indicated. GOM on skin biopsy is diagnostic but can be negative. Anterior temporal pole involvement on MRI is a useful diagnostic marker.\n",

      "PMID:  8395343\n",
      "Abs: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the anti-migraine drug and selective 5-HT1 receptor agonist, sumatriptan, on membrane potential of guinea-pig isolated trigeminal ganglion. Ganglia were divided into three longitudinally, placed in two-compartment baths and the d.c. potential between compartments was recorded extracellularly. Drugs were applied to the Krebs superfusion fluid of one compartment. KCl (3 mmol/l) and GABA (0.1 mmol/l) caused depolarization (0.30 +/- 0.05 and 0.55 +/- 0.08 mV respectively, n = 11-19). 5-HT (1-10 mumol/l) caused small depolarizations (0.06 +/- 0.02 mV, n = 8) but sumatriptan (0.1-10 mumol/l) had no effect on trigeminal ganglion membrane potential. Collagenase pretreatment, to enhance desheathing, or modification of the composition of the Krebs solution failed to reveal any effect of sumatriptan. These data provide no evidence to suggest that sumatriptan inhibits neurotransmission in trigeminal ganglion. However, 5-HT1 receptors may be present in insufficient numbers in the trigeminal ganglion to elicit a change in membrane potential. Further studies are required to investigate the effect of sumatriptan at the level of the sensory nerve terminals within the intracranial vasculature, where 5-HT1 receptors may be concentrated.\n",

      "PMID:  8549636\n",
      "Abs: The sensory neuropeptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide (alpha-CGRP), has been implicated in the pathogenesis of migraine headache. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of intracarotid infusions of human alpha-CGRP (10, 30 and 100 pmol/kg.min; n = 8), as compared to that of saline (4 times; n = 8) on haemodynamics and blood flow distribution within the carotid circulation of the anaesthetized pig, using the radioactive microsphere method. Furthermore, the effects of antimigraine drugs, dihydroergotamine (100 micrograms/kg i.v.; n = 4) or sumatriptan (300 micrograms/kg i.v.; n = 4), on these parameters were studied in the presence of the infusion of the highest concentration of human alpha-CGRP. Additionally, putative positive inotropic responses to human alpha-CGRP (10(-9)-10(-7) M) were investigated in porcine isolated atrial and ventricular trabeculae. Human alpha-CGRP increased carotid artery blood flow and conductance dose-dependently, together with an enhancement in vascular pulsations. These effects were associated with a fall in systemic blood pressure with concomitant increases in heart rate and cardiac output. The increase in carotid blood flow was reflected by an increase in total capillary blood flow, predominantly to extracerebral tissues including the dura, whereas blood flow through arteriovenous anastomoses remained stable. Both dihydroergotamine and sumatriptan reduced carotid blood flow and its capillary fraction without affecting systemic vascular conductance. In tissues, these drugs reversed blood flow increases due to human alpha-CGRP in most extracerebral tissues, but failed to reduce dural blood flow. In porcine isolated atrial and ventricular trabeculae, noradrenaline (10(-8)-10(-5) M) increased force of contraction in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, human alpha-CGRP (10(-9)-10(-7) M) failed to increase force of contraction in atrial trabeculae (n = 6) and exerted only a moderate concentration-dependent positive inotropic effect in ventricular trabeculae (approximately 25% of the response to 10(-5) M noradrenaline, n = 10). These data indicate that human alpha-CGRP caused arteriolar dilatation together with a fall in blood pressure in the pig. The tachycardia may be reflex-mediated, but the peptide also exerts a moderate positive inotropic action on ventricular trabeculae. The fall in systemic arterial blood pressure and the marked increase in capillary blood flow most likely prevented the opening of arteriovenous anastomoses. Furthermore, the antimigraine drugs, dihydroergotamine and sumatriptan, were able to reverse blood flow changes induced by human alpha-CGRP in the porcine carotid circulation.\n",

      "PMID:  19539238\n",
      "Abs: Cervical-artery dissection (CAD) is a major cause of cerebral ischaemia in young adults and can lead to various clinical symptoms, some of which are benign (eg, headache, neck pain, Horner's syndrome, and cranial-nerve palsy), but most patients have a stroke or transient ischaemic attack. In addition to trauma to the neck, other risk factors have been suggested, such as infection, migraine, hyperhomocysteinaemia, and the 677TT genotype of the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR 677TT), although evidence is sparse. An underlying arteriopathy, which could in part be genetically determined, is believed to have a role in the development of CAD. Importantly, both research on and optimum management of CAD strongly rely on diagnostic accuracy. Although the functional outcome of CAD is good in most patients, socioprofessional effects can be important. Incidence of the disorder in the general population is underestimated. Mortality and short-term recurrence rates are low but possibly also underestimated. Further research is warranted to improve our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology, to assess the long-term outcome, and ultimately to provide treatment and prevention strategies.\n",

      "PMID:  11127079\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate three patients with the mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and cerebrovascular accident syndrome (MELAS) diagnosed in childhood, with particular reference to the initial symptoms and clinical evolution during the first stage at a pediatric age, and to compare them with other studies on the subject. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two boys and a girl of 10, 11 and 13 years had tests on lactate, pyruvate and aminoacids in biological fluids under basal conditions and also functional tests and enzyme activity assay of the mitochondrial respiratory chain of a muscle biopsy. We also analysed the particular DNA mutations related to MELAS in different tissues from these patients and in lymphocytes from members of the mothers' families who could be tested. RESULTS: The patients fulfilled the clinical criteria for the MELAS syndrome. Neuroimaging showed cerebrovascular accidents. Neurophysiological studies showed myopathy in one patient and neuroaxonal neuropathy in another. In two cases ophthalmological study showed retinitis pigmentaria and during cerebrovascular accidents transient phenomena of homonymous hemianopsia and cortical blindness were seen. In all patients muscle biopsy showed ragged red fibres and the biochemical study showed an enzyme deficit in the respiratory mitochondrial chain. On molecular genetic study of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) there was a particular mutation A3243G on the tRNA(Leu) in all patients and some members of the mothers' families. CONCLUSIONS: In children with frequent episodes of migraine headaches, vomiting, refractory epilepsy and fatigue the presence of a mitochondrial disease should be suspected. On detection of mtDNA mutations MELAS may be diagnosed even without all the clinical criteria which characterise this syndrome.\n",

      "Title: Effect of TRPA1 activator allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) on rat dural and pial arteries\n",
      "PMID:  31132686\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channels may have a role in migraine as some substances known to cause headache activate the channel. In the craniovascular system such activation causes a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-dependent increase in meningeal blood flow. TRPA1 channels in the endothelium of cerebral arteries cause vasodilation when activated. The headache preventive substance feverfew inhibits activation of TRPA1 channels. In this study we aim to compare and characterize the effect of the TRPA1 agonist allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) on the diameter of rat dural and pial arteries in vivo. METHODS: The genuine closed-cranial window technique in rats was used to examine changes in dural and pial artery diameter and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) after intracarotid infusion of AITC. Blockade experiments were performed by intravenous infusion of olcegepant, HC-030031, sumatriptan or capsazepine immediately after infusion of AITC, in four different groups of rats. RESULTS: AITC caused a significant dilation of dural arteries, which was inhibited by HC-030031, olcegepant and sumatriptan, but not by capsazepine. In pial arteries AITC caused a significant dilation, which was not inhibited by any of the pre-treatments, suggesting a poor penetration of the blood-brain barrier or autoregulation due to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) mediated decrease in MABP during HC-030031 infusion. AITC did not cause a significant change in MABP. CONCLUSION: AITC causes dilation of dural arteries via a mechanism dependent on CGRP and TRPA1 that is sensitive to sumatriptan. AITC causes a small but significant dilation of pial arteries.CI - Copyright © 2019 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "PMID:  23770636\n",
      "Abs: BMS-927711 is a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist that is being developed for the treatment of migraine. A rapid, accurate and robust assay was developed and validated for the quantitation of BMS-927711 in rat, monkey, rabbit and mouse plasma using ultra high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). A simplified method screening strategy was utilized that included a liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) methodology and eleven LC columns (ten sub-2 μm UHPLC columns and one 2.6 μm HPLC column) for screening with emphasis on the removal of phospholipids, avoidance of metabolite interference and ruggedness of LC conditions. A stable isotope labeled [(13)C2, D4]-BMS-927711 was used as the internal standard, and 50 μL of plasma samples were used for extraction by automated LLE with methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) in 96-well format. Chromatographic separation was achieved with an isocratic elution and a gradient column wash on a Waters Acuity UPLC(®) BEH C18 column (2.1 mm × 50 mm, 1.7 μm) with run time of 3.7 min. Positive electrospray ionization was performed using selected reaction monitoring (SRM) with transitions of m/z 535>256 for BMS-927711 and m/z 541>256 for [(13)C2, D4]-BMS-927711. The standard curve, which ranged from 3.00 to 3000 ng/mL for BMS-927711, was fitted to a 1/x(2) weighted linear regression model. The intra-assay precision was within 5.2% CV, inter-assay precision was within 5.9% CV, and the assay accuracy was within ±5.2% deviation (%Dev) of the nominal values in all the species. The stability of an N-carbamoyl glucuronide metabolite was carefully investigated, and the conversion of this metabolite to BMS-927711 was minimal and manageable without a stabilization procedure. The method was successfully applied to multiple non-clinical toxicokinetic studies in different species in support of the investigative new drug (IND) filing.CI - Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

      "PMID:  18336953\n",
      "Abs: Valproate, a widely used anti-epileptic drug also employed in the treatment of neurological diseases such as bipolar disorder and migraine, regulates the glutamatergic and GABAergic systems, although its effects in cell physiology have not been thoroughly characterized. High concentrations of glutamate reached during abnormal neurotransmission if not removed properly, become neurotoxic. Glutamate clearance is carried out by high affinity Na(+)-dependent glutamate transporter systems. The glutamate/aspartate transporter GLAST/EAAT1 plays the major role in glutamate removal and is regulated at different levels: transcription, post-translational modifications and cytoplasmic trafficking. The aim of this work was to gain insight into a plausible effect of valproate in GLAST function. Using cultured Bergmann glia cells from chick cerebellum we demonstrate here that valproate exposure elicits a dual regulatory effect on GLAST. In the short-term, valproate increases its Na(+)-dependent [(3)H]-d-aspartate uptake activity in a cytochalasin B-sensitive manner. Interestingly, a synergism between valproate and a histone deacetylase inhibitor was observed. Long-term valproate treatment up-regulates chglast promoter activity, GLAST mRNA levels, GLAST molecules at the plasma membrane and its uptake activity. Furthermore, valproate induces histone 3 lysine 14 acetylation and regulates Ying-Yang 1 (YY1) transcriptional repression on the chglast promoter. These results suggest that valproate elicits its effect through its histone deacetylase inhibitor properties.\n",

      "PMID:  21620424\n",
      "Abs: Feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium) is a perennial medicinal herb and is a rich source of sesquiterpene lactones. Parthenolide is the main sesquiterpene lactone in feverfew and has attracted attention because of its medicinal potential for treatment of migraine and cancer. In the present work the parthenolide content in different tissues and developmental stages of feverfew was analyzed to study the timing and localization of parthenolide biosynthesis. The strongest accumulating tissue was subsequently used to isolate sesquiterpene synthases with the goal to isolate the gene encoding the first dedicated step in parthenolide biosynthesis. This led to the isolation and charachterization of a germacrene A synthase (TpGAS) and an (E)-β-caryophyllene synthase (TpCarS). Transcript level patterns of both sesquiterpene synthases were analyzed in different tissues and glandular trichomes. Although TpGAS was expressed in all aerial tissues, the highest expression was observed in tissues that contain high concentrations of parthenolide and in flowers the highest expression was observed in the biosynthetically most active stages of flower development. The high expression of TpGAS in glandular trichomes which also contain the highest concentration of parthenolide, suggests that glandular trichomes are the secretory tissues where parthenolide biosynthesis and accumulation occur.CI - Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

      "PMID:  12151389\n",
      "Abs: The sesquiterpene lactone parthenolide, the principal active component in medicinal plants, has been used conventionally to treat migraines, inflammation, and tumors. However, the antitumor effects of parthenolide and the mechanism(s) involved are poorly understood. We found that parthenolide effectively inhibits hepatoma cell growth in a tumor cell-specific manner and triggers apoptosis of hepatoma cells. Parthenolide triggered apoptosis in invasive sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma cells (SH-J1) as well as in other ordinary hepatoma cells at 5-10 microm concentrations and arrested the cell growth (at G(2)/M) at sublethal concentrations (1-3 microm). During parthenolide-induced apoptosis, depletion of glutathione, generation of reactive oxygen species, reduction of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, activation of caspases (caspases-7, -8, and -9), overexpression of GADD153 (an oxidative stress or anticancer agent inducible gene), and subsequent apoptotic cell death was observed. This induced apoptosis could be effectively inhibited or abrogated by an antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine, whereas l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine enhanced it. Furthermore, stable overexpression of GADD153 sensitized the cells to apoptosis induced by parthenolide, and this susceptibility could be reversed by transfection with an antisense to GADD153. Parthenolide did not alter the expression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-X(L) proteins during apoptosis in hepatoma cells. Oxidative stress may contribute to parthenolide-induced apoptosis and to GADD153 overexpression in a glutathione-sensitive manner. The sensitivity of tumor cells to parthenolide appears to result from the low expression level of the multifunctional detoxification enzyme glutathione S-transferase pi. Finally, parthenolide and its derivatives may be useful chemotherapeutic agents to treat these invasive cancers.\n",

      "Title: Quantitative trait loci modifying cardiac atrial septal morphology and risk of patent foramen ovale in the mouse\n",
      "PMID:  16484617\n",
      "Abs: Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a common congenital heart disease (CHD) occurring in 5 to 7 per 10,000 live births. Mutations in 5 human genes (NKX2.5, TBX5, GATA4, MYHC, ACTC) are known to cause dominant ASD, but these account for a minority of cases. Human and mouse data suggest that ASD exists in an anatomical continuum with milder septal variants patent foramen ovale (PFO) and atrial septal aneurysm, strongly associated with ischemic stroke and migraine. We have previously shown in inbred mice that the incidence of PFO strongly correlates with length of the interatrial septum primum, defining a quantitative trait underlying PFO risk. To better understand genetic causation of atrial septal abnormalities, we mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) influencing septal morphology using mouse strains (QSi5 and 129T2/SvEms) maximally informative for PFO incidence and 3 quantitative septal anatomical traits including septum primum length. [QSi5x129T2/SvEms]F2 intercross animals (n=1437) were phenotyped and a whole genome scan performed at an average 17-cM interval. Statistical methodology scoring PFO as a binary phenotype was developed as a confirmatory mapping technique. We mapped 7 significant and 6 suggestive QTL modifying quantitative phenotypes, with 4 supported by binary analysis. Quantitative traits, although strongly associated with PFO (P<0.001), correlated poorly with each other and in all but 1 case QTL for different traits were nonoverlapping. Thus, multiple anatomical processes under separate genetic control contribute to risk of PFO. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of modeling the genetic basis of common CHD using animal genetic and genomic technologies.\n",

      "PMID:  30053855\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) associated with mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) typically manifests only optic nerve involvement but in some patients may develop additional neurological complications. The cause of this association is not clear. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 24-year-old male with a history of subacute, painless, and rapidly progressive bilateral vision loss. We performed ophthalmological, neurological and neuropsychological investigations in the proband and his LHON family. The proband showed optic neuropathy, epilepsy, migraine, and intellectual disability; all the maternal relatives did not manifest optic neuropathy but a moderate to severe intellectual disability. Genetic screening revealed a novel association of the LHON m.3460G > A primary mutation with the m.T961delT + C(n)ins within the mitochondrial encoded 12S RNA (MTRNR1) gene which segregates with the intellectual disability through the maternal branch of the family. We also found a significant increase of mtDNA content in all the unaffected homo/heteroplasmic mutation carriers with respect to either affected or control subjects. CONCLUSION: This is the first case reporting the co-segregation of a mutation in MTRNR1 gene with a LHON primary mutation, which may be a risk factor of the extraocular signs complicating LHON phenotype. In addition, the data herein reported, confirmed that the key factor modulating the penetrance of optic atrophy in the family is the amount of mtDNA.\n",

      "PMID:  28767512\n",
      "Abs: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a genetic disorder linked to inactivating mutations or a homozygous deletion of the Nf1 gene, is characterized by tumorigenesis, cognitive dysfunction, seizures, migraine, and pain. Omic studies on human NF1 tissues identified an increase in the expression of collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), a cytosolic protein reported to regulate the trafficking and activity of presynaptic N-type voltage-gated calcium (Cav2.2) channels. Because neurofibromin, the protein product of the Nf1 gene, binds to and inhibits CRMP2, the neurofibromin-CRMP2 signaling cascade will likely affect Ca channel activity and regulate nociceptive neurotransmission and in vivo responses to noxious stimulation. Here, we investigated the function of neurofibromin-CRMP2 interaction on Cav2.2. Mapping of >275 peptides between neurofibromin and CRMP2 identified a 15-amino acid CRMP2-derived peptide that, when fused to the tat transduction domain of HIV-1, inhibited Ca influx in dorsal root ganglion neurons. This peptide mimics the negative regulation of CRMP2 activity by neurofibromin. Neurons treated with tat-CRMP2/neurofibromin regulating peptide 1 (t-CNRP1) exhibited a decreased Cav2.2 membrane localization, and uncoupling of neurofibromin-CRMP2 and CRMP2-Cav2.2 interactions. Proteomic analysis of a nanodisc-solubilized membrane protein library identified syntaxin 1A as a novel CRMP2-binding protein whose interaction with CRMP2 was strengthened in neurofibromin-depleted cells and reduced by t-CNRP1. Stimulus-evoked release of calcitonin gene-related peptide from lumbar spinal cord slices was inhibited by t-CNRP1. Intrathecal administration of t-CNRP1 was antinociceptive in experimental models of inflammatory, postsurgical, and neuropathic pain. Our results demonstrate the utility of t-CNRP1 to inhibit CRMP2 protein-protein interactions for the potential treatment of pain.\n",

      "Title: Effect of carbon dioxide on calcitonin gene-related peptide secretion from trigeminal neurons\n",
      "PMID:  18052948\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine whether the physiological effects of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) involve regulation of CGRP secretion from trigeminal sensory neurons. BACKGROUND: The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is implicated in the pathophysiology of allergic rhinosinusitis and migraine. Recent clinical evidence supports the use of noninhaled intranasal delivery of 100% CO(2) for treatment of these diseases. Patients report 2 distinct physiological events: first, a short duration stinging or burning sensation within the nasal mucosa, and second, alleviation of primary symptoms. METHODS: Primary cultures of rat trigeminal ganglia were utilized to investigate the effects of CO(2) on CGRP release stimulated by a depolarizing stimulus (KCl), capsaicin, nitric oxide, and/or protons. The amount of CGRP secreted into the culture media was determined using a CGRP-specific radioimmunoassay. Intracellular pH and calcium levels were measured in cultured trigeminal neurons in response to CO(2) and stimulatory agents using fluorescent imaging techniques. RESULTS: Incubation of primary trigeminal ganglia cultures at pH 6.0 or 5.5 was shown to significantly stimulate CGRP release. Similarly, CO(2) treatment of cultures caused a time-dependent acidification of the media, achieving pH values of 5.5-6 that stimulated CGRP secretion. In addition, KCl, capsaicin, and a nitric oxide donor also caused a significant increase in CGRP release. Interestingly, CO(2) treatment of cultures under isohydric conditions, which prevents extracellular acidification while allowing changes in PCO(2) values, significantly repressed the stimulatory effects of KCl, capsaicin, and nitric oxide on CGRP secretion. We found that CO(2) treatment under isohydric conditions resulted in a decrease in intracellular pH and inhibition of the KCl- and capsaicin-mediated increases in intracellular calcium. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study provide the first evidence of a unique regulatory mechanism by which CO(2) inhibits sensory nerve activation, and subsequent neuropeptide release. Furthermore, the observed inhibitory effect of CO(2) on CGRP secretion likely involves modulation of calcium channel activity and changes in intracellular pH.\n",

      "Title: CGRP receptor activity in mice with global expression of human receptor activity modifying protein 1\n",
      "PMID:  28317098\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CGRP is a potent vasodilator and nociceptive neuropeptide linked to migraine. CGRP receptors are heterodimers of receptor activity modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) and either calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR; forms canonical CGRP receptor) or calcitonin receptor (CT receptor; forms AMY(1) receptor). The goal of this study was to test whether transgenic mice globally expressing human RAMP1 have increased CGRP receptor activity and whether the receptors are sensitive to human selective antagonist telcagepant. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: cAMP production was measured in primary cultures of aortic smooth muscle and trigeminal ganglia neurons from global hRAMP1 mice and non-transgenic littermates. Functional activity and inhibition were compared with clonal cell lines expressing combinations of CLR or CT receptors with RAMP1. KEY RESULTS: Cultured smooth muscle from global hRAMP1 mice had a 10-fold greater CGRP-induced cAMP maximal response (Rmax) than non-transgenic littermates, with similar EC(50) s. In contrast, cultured trigeminal ganglia from global hRAMP1 mice had a 40-fold leftward shift of the EC(50) , with similar Rmax values as littermates. In both hRAMP1 cultures, telcagepant blocked CGRP-induced cAMP production, but was not effective in non-transgenic cultures. IC(50) values were closer to those observed for CT receptor/hRAMP1 than CLR/hRAMP1 in clonal cell lines. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Overexpression of hRAMP1 increases CGRP signalling by changing the maximal response or ligand sensitivity, depending on tissue type. Furthermore, telcagepant inhibited transgenic hRAMP1 CGRP receptors, but the degree of inhibition suggests that the transgenic mice are only partially humanized or both canonical CGRP and AMY(1) receptors are functional in trigeminal ganglia neurons and vascular smooth muscle.CI - © 2017 The British Pharmacological Society.\n",

      "PMID:  30285053\n",
      "Abs: IMPORTANCE: Data on neurologic manifestations of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) are rare, and current knowledge remains limited. OBJECTIVES: To present a comprehensive review of the epidemiologic characteristics, management, and prognosis of the neurologic manifestations associated with cerebrovascular FMD (ie, involving cervical or intracranial arteries) and to guide future research priorities. EVIDENCE REVIEW: References were identified through searches of PubMed from inception to December 2017 using both the medical subject headings and text words. Additional sources were also identified by reviewing reference lists of relevant articles and through searches of the authors' personal files. Selected articles described at least 1 clinical or radiologic feature and/or outcome of cerebrovascular FMD. Isolated case reports could be included if they described interesting or noteworthy manifestations of FMD. FINDINGS: A total of 84 relevant references were identified. Diagnosis of cerebrovascular FMD is based on the appearance of alternating arterial dilatation and constriction (\"string of beads\") or of focal narrowing, with no sign of atherosclerotic or inflammatory lesions. Although the diagnosis is easily apparent on results of radiographic imaging, making a diagnosis can be challenging in children or individuals with atypical phenotypes, such as purely intracranial FMD and arterial diaphragm. Involvement of multiple arteries is common, and there is increased incidence of cervical artery dissection and intracranial aneurysms. A variant in the PHACTR1 gene has been associated with FMD as well as cervical artery dissection and migraine, although less than 5% of cases of FMD are familial. Headaches, mainly of the migraine type, are observed in up to 70% of patients with FMD. Cerebrovascular FMD is mostly asymptomatic, but the most frequent neurologic manifestations include transient ischemic attack and ischemic stroke, notably in the presence of associated cervical artery dissection. Other conditions associated with FMD include subarachnoid hemorrhage and, rarely, intracranial hemorrhage. Management relies on observational data and expert opinion. Antiplatelet therapy is considered reasonable to prevent thromboembolic complications. Endovascular therapy is typically restricted to cases with symptomatic stenosis despite optimal medical therapy or in those with rupture of an intracranial aneurysm. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Longitudinal cohort studies of individuals of multiple ethnicities with biosampling are needed to better understand the risk factors, pathophysiological features, and outcomes of FMD. Patient advocacy groups could assist researchers in answering patient-centered questions regarding FMD.\n",

      "PMID:  28192258\n",
      "Abs: AIM: The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is found in afferent sensory nerve fibers innervating the resistance arteries and plays a pivotal role in a number of neurovascular diseases such as migraine and subarachnoid bleedings. The present study investigates the binding and antagonistic characteristics of small non-peptide CGRP receptor antagonists (i.e. gepants) in isolated rat brain and mesenteric resistance arteries. METHODS: The antagonistic behavior of gepants was investigated in isolated rat mesenteric arteries using a wire myograph setup while binding of gepants to CGRP receptors was investigated in rat brain membranes using a radioligand competitive binding assay. Furthermore, the histological location of the key components of CGRP receptor (RAMP1 and CLR) was assessed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Our functional studies clearly show that all gepants are reversible competitive antagonists producing Schild plot slopes not significantly different from unity and thus suggesting presence of a uniform CGRP receptor population in the arteries. A uniform receptor population was also confirmed by radioligand competitive binding studies showing similar affinities for the gepants in rat brain and mesenteric arteries, the exception being rimegepant which had 50-fold lower affinity in brain than mesenteric arteries. CLR and RAMP1 were shown to be located in both vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells of rat mesenteric arteries by immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSION: The present results indicate that, despite species differences in the CGRP receptor affinity, the antagonistic nature of these gepants, the distribution pattern of CGRP receptor components and the mechanism behind CGRP-induced vasodilation seem to be similar in resistance-sized arteries of human and rats.CI - Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

      "PMID:  30002430\n",
      "Abs: Angelica gigas Nakai (AGN) is an oriental traditional medicine to treat anemia, dysmenorrhea, and migraine. However, its anti-lymphoma effect is yet to be tested. Here, we demonstrated that AGN and its major component decursin target Myc to suppress lymphomagenesis in vitro and in vivo. AGN inhibited cell viability in multiple B lymphoma cells, while sparing normal splenocytes and bone marrow cells. Increased cleaved PARP level and caspase 3/7 activity and the repression of survival-promoting AKT/mTOR and MAPK pathways downstream of BCR, were responsible for the pro-apoptotic effects of AGN. We found that Myc, a prominent downstream target of these signaling pathways, contributes to AGN-induced cell death. Moreover, co-treatment with AGN and a Myc inhibitor, JQ1 or 10058-F4 yielded synergistic cytotoxic activities against cancer cells with markedly reduced Myc expression. AGN downregulated Myc expression and suppressed tumorigenesis in Eμ-myc transgenic mice. The proapoptotic activities of AGN were recapitulated by decursin, indicating that the anti-tumor effect of AGN was mainly caused by decursin. These findings suggest that AGN and decursin possess potent anti-lymphoma activity, and combination therapies with AGN/decursin and a Myc inhibitor to target Myc more efficiently could be a valuable avenue to explore in the treatment of B-cell lymphoma.\n",

      "PMID:  19914210\n",
      "Abs: The receptor for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has been the target for the development of novel small molecule antagonists for the treatment of migraine. Two such antagonists, BIBN4096BS and MK-0974, have shown great promise in clinical trials and hence a deeper understanding of the mechanism of their interaction with the receptor is now required. The structure of the CGRP receptor is unusual since it is comprised of a hetero-oligomeric complex between the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRL) and an accessory protein (RAMP1). Both the CLR and RAMP1 components have extracellular domains which interact with each other and together form part of the peptide-binding site. It seems likely that the antagonist binding site will also be located on the extracellular domains and indeed Trp-74 of RAMP1 has been shown to form part of the binding site for BIBN4096BS. However, despite a chimeric study demonstrating the role of the N-terminal domain of CLR in antagonist binding, no specific residues have been identified. Here we carry out a mutagenic screen of the extreme N-terminal domain of CLR (residues 23-63) and identify a mutant, Met-42-Ala, which displays 48-fold lower affinity for BIBN4096BS and almost 900-fold lower affinity for MK-0974. In addition, we confirm that the Trp-74-Lys mutation at human RAMP1 reduces BIBN4096BS affinity by over 300-fold and show for the first time a similar effect for MK-0974 affinity. The data suggest that the non-peptide antagonists occupy a binding site close to the interface of the N-terminal domains of CLR and RAMP1.CI - Copyright 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n",

      "PMID:  29273026\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Population genetic diversity and structure are determined by past and current evolutionary processes, among which spatially limited dispersal, genetic drift, and shifts in species distribution boundaries have major effects. In most wildlife species, environmental modifications by humans often lead to contraction of species' ranges and/or limit their dispersal by acting as environmental barriers. However, in species well adapted to anthropogenic habitat or open landscapes, human induced environmental changes may facilitate dispersal and range expansions. In this study, we analysed whether isolation by distance and deforestation, among other environmental features, promotes or restricts dispersal and expansion in stone marten (Martes foina) populations. RESULTS: We genotyped 298 martens from eight sites at twenty-two microsatellite loci to characterize the genetic variability, population structure and demographic history of stone martens in Poland. At the landscape scale, limited genetic differentiation between sites in a mosaic of urban, rural and forest habitats was mostly influenced by isolation by distance. Statistical clustering and multivariate analyses showed weak genetic structuring with two to four clusters and a high rate of gene flow between them. Stronger genetic differentiation was detected for one stone marten population (NE1) located inside a large forest complex. Genetic differentiation between this site and all others was 20% higher than between other sites separated by similar distances. The genetic uniqueness index of NE1 was also twofold higher than in other sites. Past demographic history analyses showed recent expansion of this species in north-eastern Poland. A decrease in genetic diversity from south to north, and MIGRAINE analyses indicated the direction of expansion of stone marten. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that two processes, changes in species distribution boundaries and limited dispersal associated with landscape barriers, affect genetic diversity and structure in stone marten. Analysis of local barriers that reduced dispersal and large scale analyses of genetic structure and demographic history highlight the importance of isolation by distance and forest cover for the past colonization of central Europe by stone marten. This confirmed the hypothesis that human-landscape changes (deforestation) accelerated stone marten expansion, to which climate warming probably has also been contributing over the last few decades.\n",

      "Title: Anandamide acts as a vasodilator of dural blood vessels in vivo by activating TRPV1 receptors\n",
      "PMID:  15277315\n",
      "Abs: Migraine pathophysiology is believed to involve the release of neuropeptides via the activation of trigeminal afferents that innervate the cranial vasculature. Anandamide, the endogenous ligand to the cannabinoid receptor, is able to inhibit neurogenic dural vasodilatation, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-induced and nitric oxide-induced dural vessel dilation in the intravital microscopy model. In an in vitro setting anandamide is also able to activate the vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) receptor and cause vasodilation, via the release of CGRP. In this study we used intravital microscopy to study whether anandamide behaves as a TRPV1 receptor agonist in the trigeminovascular system. We examined if anandamide-induced dural vasodilation involves CGRP release that can be reversed by the CGRP receptor antagonist, CGRP(8-37), and whether like capsaicin the anandamide effect could be reversed by the TRPV1 receptor antagonist, capsazepine. Anandamide 1 (19+/-9%, n=12), 3 (29+/-5%, n=37), 5 (74+/-7%, n=13) and 10 mg kg(-1) (89+/-18%, n=6) was able to cause a dose-dependent increase in dural vessel diameter. Capsazepine (3 mg kg(-1), t(5)=6.2, P<0.05) and CGRP(8-37) (300 micrograms kg(-1), t(6)=11.1, P<0.05) attenuated the anandamide-induced dural vessel dilation when compared to control (Student's paired t-test). AM251 (3 mg kg(-1)), a cannabinoid type 1 (CB(1)) receptor antagonist, was unable to reverse this anandamide-induced dilation. The study demonstrates that anandamide acts as a TRPV1 receptor agonist in the trigeminovascular system, activating TRPV1 receptors that promote CGRP release and cause vasodilation independent of any action at the CB(1) receptor. Anandamide has been shown previously to inhibit trigeminovascular neurons and prevent vasodilation, through an action at CB(1) receptors.\n",

      "PMID:  12527134\n",
      "Abs: The type 1 vanilloid receptor (VR1) is a non-specific cation channel activated by capsaicin, lipoxygenase (LOX) products, heat and acid. This study demonstrates VR1 and 5-LOX expression by inner ear ganglion cells. A PCR product (210 bp) was amplified from both oligo(dT)- and random primer-generated cDNAs of rat spiral ganglion cells using VR1 gene-specific primers constructed from the 3' non-homologous region. This PCR product shared 100% sequence homology to a rat VR1 cDNA (GenBank accession no. AF029310) and a rat vanilloid receptor splice variant mRNA (GenBank accession no. AF158248). Frozen sections of PLP-fixed, decalcified Long-Evans rat temporal bones were stained immunohistochemically for VR1. Neurons and satellite cells in both the vestibular and spiral ganglia were VR1-immunopositive. Neurons and supporting cells in adjacent sections of these ganglia were immunopositive for 5-LOX. These findings raise the hypothesis that activation of VR1 by endogenous ligands may contribute to hypersensitivity of the eighth nerve to hair cell inputs in a variety of pathologic conditions, such as tinnitus, Meniere's disease and migraine. In particular, these data suggest that LOX activation during inflammatory processes or during cyclo-oxygenase inhibition (e.g. by aspirin) is a potential intrinsic source of VR1 activation in inner ear ganglia.CI - Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.\n",

      "PMID:  25215881\n",
      "Abs: Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is an atrial septal deformity present in around 25% of the general population. PFO is associated with major causes of morbidity, including stroke and migraine. PFO appears to be heritable but genes involved in the closure of foramen ovale have not been identified. The aim of this study is to determine molecular pathways and genes that are responsible to the postnatal closure of the foramen ovale. Using Sprague-Dawley rat hearts as a model we analysed the dynamic histological changes and gene expressions at the foramen ovale region between embryonic day 20 and postnatal day 7. We observed a gradual loss of the endothelial marker PECAM1, an upregulation of the mesenchymal marker vimentin and α-smooth muscle actin, the elevation of the transcription factor Snail, and an increase of fibroblast activation protein (FAP) in the foramen ovale region as well as the deposition of collagen-rich connective tissues at the closed foramen ovale, suggesting endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) occurring during foramen ovale closure which leads to fibrosis. In addition, Notch1 and Notch3 receptors, Notch ligand Jagged1 and Notch effector HRT1 were highly expressed in the endocardium of the foramen ovale region during EndMT. Activation of Notch3 alone in an endothelial cell culture model was able to drive EndMT and transform endothelial cells to mesenchymal phenotype. Our data demonstrate for the first time that FO closure is a process of EndMT-mediated fibrosis, and Notch signalling is an important player participating in this process. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of the closure of foramen ovale informs the pathogenesis of PFO and may provide potential options for screening and prevention of PFO related conditions.\n",

      "PMID:  28988699\n",
      "Abs: The Na(+),K(+)-ATPase is a plasma membrane ion transporter of high physiological importance for ion homeostasis and cellular excitability in electrically active tissues. Mutations in the genes coding for Na(+),K(+)-ATPase α-subunit isoforms lead to severe human pathologies including Familial Hemiplegic Migraine type 2, Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood, Rapid-onset Dystonia Parkinsonism, or epilepsy. Many of the reported mutations lead to change- or loss-of-function effects, whereas others do not alter the functional properties, but lead to, e.g., reduced protein stability, reduced protein expression, or defective plasma membrane targeting. Na(+),K(+)-ATPase frequently assembles with other membrane transporters or cellular matrix proteins in specialized plasma membrane microdomains, but the effects of these interactions on targeting or protein mobility are elusive so far. Mutation of established interaction motifs of the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase with ankyrin B and caveolin-1 are expected to result in changes in plasma membrane targeting, changes of the localization pattern, and of the diffusion behavior of the enzyme. We studied the consequences of mutations in these binding sites by monitoring diffusion of eGFP-labeled Na(+),K(+)-ATPase constructs in the plasma membrane of HEK293T cells by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy as well as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching or photoswitching, and observed significant differences compared to the wild-type enzyme, with synergistic effects for combinations of interaction site mutations. These measurements expand the possibilities to study the consequences of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase mutations and provide information about the interaction of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase α-isoforms with cellular matrix proteins, the cytoskeleton, or other membrane protein complexes.CI - Copyright © 2017 Biophysical Society.

      "PMID:  22016976\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: To observe the herbal effects on hyperthyroidism patients with syndrome of hyperactivity of liver-Yang by method for calming the liver and suppressing Yang and investigate its effects on the lymphocyte protein expression. This approach may lay a foundation for the further investigation of the curative mechanisms of calming the liver and suppressing Yang treatment. METHOD: A total of 48 hyperthyroidism patients with syndrome of hyperactivity of liver-Yang were randomly divided into treatment group and control group. The treatment group was treated by method for calming the liver and suppressing Yang in accordance with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and the control group with thiamazole tablets for three periods of treatment The therapeutic effects, the score of TCM symptom, electrocardiogram (P wave), thyroid hormones and ultrasound were observed in both groups before and after the treatment. The side effects in the treatment course were observed in both groups. The level of differential protein expression was analyzed by two-dimensional electrphoresis and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionizaton time-of-flight mass spectrometry. RESULT: The treatment group has the effect on stepping down the heart rate, cutting down the P wave amplitude changes, regulating the level of thyroid hormones and decreasing the volume of thyromegaly. There are not statistically significant between the treatment group and control group. However, the treatment group has obviously better effect on regulating TCM symptom and decreasing the side reaction than the control group (P<0.05). There are not statistically significant on the total effective between the treatment group and control group. The average spots in lymphocyte for normal people, before and after treating hyperthyroidism patients with syndrome of hyperactivity of liver-Yang were (429 +/- 31), (452 +/- 28) and (437 +/- 36) spots respectively. Eight down-regulated protein expressions and 11 up-regulated protein expressions were obtained in the hyperthyroidism patients with syndrome of hyperactivity of liver-Yang and normal people. Five strengthened expressions of protein were also obtained in 8 down-regulated expressions of protein and 8 lower expressions of protein in 11 up-regulated expressions of protein before and after treating the migraine patients with syndrome of hyperactivity of liver-Yang. Ten of the total 8 differential protein spots were successfully identified by MALDI-TOF-MS. The functions of these proteins were involved in metabolism associated, transportation, antioxidation, sigal transduction and immume associated protein, etc. according to information provided by NCBI and MSDB database. CONCLUSION: In this study, the TCM complex prescription with herbs for calming the liver and suppressing Yang can regulate the thyroid hormones, improves TCM symptoms, and decrease the adverse reaction. It can possibly regulate lymphocyte protein expression.\n",

      "Title: Endogenous nitric oxide synthesis: biological functions and pathophysiology\n",
      "PMID:  10630682\n",
      "Abs: Modern molecular biology has revealed vast numbers of large and complex proteins and genes that regulate body function. By contrast, discoveries over the past ten years indicate that crucial features of neuronal communication, blood vessel modulation and immune response are mediated by a remarkably simple chemical, nitric oxide (NO). Endogenous NO is generated from arginine by a family of three distinct calmodulin- dependent NO synthase (NOS) enzymes. NOS from endothelial cells (eNOS) and neurons (nNOS) are both constitutively expressed enzymes, whose activities are stimulated by increases in intracellular calcium. Immune functions for NO are mediated by a calcium-independent inducible NOS (iNOS). Expression of iNOS protein requires transcriptional activation, which is mediated by specific combinations of cytokines. All three NOS use NADPH as an electron donor and employ five enzyme cofactors to catalyze a five-electron oxidation of arginine to NO with stoichiometric formation of citrulline. The highest levels of NO throughout the body are found in neurons, where NO functions as a unique messenger molecule. In the autonomic nervous system NO functions NO functions as a major non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) neurotransmitter. This NANC pathway plays a particularly important role in producing relaxation of smooth muscle in the cerebral circulation and the gastrointestinal, urogenital and respiratory tracts. Dysregulation of NOS activity in autonomic nerves plays a major role in diverse pathophysiological conditions including migraine headache, hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and male impotence. In the brain, NO functions as a neuromodulator and appears to mediate aspects of learning and memory. Although endogenous NO was originally appreciated as a mediator of smooth muscle relaxation, NO also plays a major role in skeletal muscle. Physiologically muscle-derived NO regulates skeletal muscle contractility and exercise-induced glucose uptake. nNOS occurs at the plasma membrane of skeletal muscle which facilitates diffusion of NO to the vasculature to regulate muscle perfusion. nNOS protein occurs in the dystrophin complex in skeletal muscle and NO may therefore participate in the pathophysiology of muscular dystrophy. NO signalling in excitable tissues requires rapid and controlled delivery of NO to specific cellular targets. This tight control of NO signalling is largely regulated at the level of NO biosynthesis. Acute control of nNOS activity is mediated by allosteric enzyme regulation, by posttranslational modification and by subcellular targeting of the enzyme. nNOS protein levels are also dynamically regulated by changes in gene transcription, and this affords long-lasting changes in tissue NO levels. While NO normally functions as a physiological neuronal mediator, excess production of NO mediates brain injury. Overactivation of glutamate receptors associated with cerebral ischemia and other excitotoxic processes results in massive release of NO. As a free radical, NO is inherently reactive and mediates cellular toxicity by damaging critical metabolic enzymes and by reacting with superoxide to form an even more potent oxidant, peroxynitrite. Through these mechanisms, NO appears to play a major role in the pathophysiology of stroke, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n",

      "PMID:  31364988\n",
      "Abs: Mutations in pre-synaptic voltage-gated calcium channels can lead to familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1). While mammalian studies indicate that the migraine brain is hyperexcitable due to enhanced excitation or reduced inhibition, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance are poorly understood. We identified a gain-of-function (gf) mutation in the Caenorhabditis elegans CaV2 channel α1 subunit, UNC-2, which leads to increased calcium currents. unc-2(zf35gf) mutants exhibit hyperactivity and seizure-like motor behaviors. Expression of the unc-2 gene with FHM1 substitutions R192Q and S218L leads to hyperactivity similar to that of unc-2(zf35gf) mutants. unc-2(zf35gf) mutants display increased cholinergic and decreased GABAergic transmission. Moreover, increased cholinergic transmission in unc-2(zf35gf) mutants leads to an increase of cholinergic synapses and a TAX-6/calcineurin-dependent reduction of GABA synapses. Our studies reveal mechanisms through which CaV2 gain-of-function mutations disrupt excitation-inhibition balance in the nervous system.CI - © 2019, Huang et al.\n",

      "PMID:  25016583\n",
      "Abs: Understanding the demographic history of populations and species is a central issue in evolutionary biology and molecular ecology. In this work, we develop a maximum-likelihood method for the inference of past changes in population size from microsatellite allelic data. Our method is based on importance sampling of gene genealogies, extended for new mutation models, notably the generalized stepwise mutation model (GSM). Using simulations, we test its performance to detect and characterize past reductions in population size. First, we test the estimation precision and confidence intervals coverage properties under ideal conditions, then we compare the accuracy of the estimation with another available method (MSVAR) and we finally test its robustness to misspecification of the mutational model and population structure. We show that our method is very competitive compared with alternative ones. Moreover, our implementation of a GSM allows more accurate analysis of microsatellite data, as we show that the violations of a single step mutation assumption induce very high bias toward false contraction detection rates. However, our simulation tests also showed some limits, which most importantly are large computation times for strong disequilibrium scenarios and a strong influence of some form of unaccounted population structure. This inference method is available in the latest implementation of the MIGRAINE software package.CI - © The Author 2014.

      "PMID:  12861956\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: There are conflicting data about the role of Leiden mutation in the pathogenesis of cerebral arterial thrombosis. In order to obtain relevant data, authors investigated the prevalence of factor V Leiden (A506G) both in healthy subjects and in a subgroup of ischaemic stroke patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Blood samples of 171 healthy persons and 254 ischaemic stroke patients were examined by PCR method for Leiden mutation. Ischaemic lesions in the stroke group were documented by CT or MRI. A routine questionnaire was used to study the family history of vascular events (hypertension, diabetes, POAD, stroke, myocardial infarction) of patients. Conventional vascular risk factors of patients were also documented. RESULTS: The prevalence of Leiden mutation was 7.2% in healthy persons and 11.9% in stroke patients. The OR for 254 patient was 1.45 (0.71-2.97). In the subgroup of young patients: age < 50 (n = 134) the OR was 1.67 (0.75-3.70) and in the elderly patients group: age > 50 (n = 120) the OR was 1.21 (0.50-2.89). In the family history of stroke patients having Leiden mutation (hetero- and homozygosity) the stroke prevalence was higher (p = 0.01). In the ischaemic stroke group, age < 50 with polymorphism a tight correlation with hyperlipidaemia (p = 0.03) was found. In the group of age < 50 with heterozygosity for Leiden, a lower plasma fibrinogen concentration (p = 0.02) was found. The polymorphism showed no correlation with the hypertension, hyperuricaemia, migraine, diabetes mellitus, smoking, alcohol consumption and CDS status of patients. CONCLUSION: When comparing stroke patients to control population there is no significant increase in the frequency of Leiden mutation. Leiden mutation together with hyperlipidaemia and stroke in the family history results in high risk for ischaemic stroke in young patients.\n",

      "PMID:  12100087\n",
      "Abs: The purpose of this study was to use intravital microscopy to determine the effect of a selective adenosine A1 receptor agonist, GR79236 (1, 3 and 10 microg/kg i.v.), on neurogenic dural blood vessel dilation in anaesthetized rats. Vasodilation was evoked either by electrical stimulation of perivascular trigeminal nerves or by intravenous CGRP. GR79236 (1-10 microg/kg i.v.) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of neurogenic vasodilation, but had no significant effect on dural vasodilation caused by CGRP. GR79236 (1-3 microg/kg i.v.) had no effect on basal dural vessel diameter, but caused transient dose-dependant bradycardia and hypotension. Bradycardia was more prolonged following 10 microg/kg i.v. GR79236. Pre-treatment with the adenosine A1 receptor antagonist DPCPX (1 mg/kg i.v.) prevented the inhibitory effect of GR79236 (10 microg/kg i.v.) on neurogenic vasodilation as well as GR79236-induced bradycardia and hypotension. These data suggest that the inhibition of neurogenic vasodilation by GR79236 is mediated via the activation of prejunctional adenosine A1 receptors. Provided the systemic cardiovascular effects could be limited, such a mechanism may offer a novel approach to migraine therapy.\n",

      "Abs: Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia (SIOD) is a multisystemic condition characterized by early arteriosclerosis and progressive renal insufficiency, among other features. Many SIOD patients have severe, migraine-like headaches, transient neurologic attacks, or cerebral ischemic events. Cerebral events could be exacerbated or precipitated by hypertension, and it is unclear how these are related to arteriosclerotic changes as dyslipidemia is also a feature of SIOD. The correlation between hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular risk in SIOD is unclear. Also, the etiology and management of headaches is not well characterized. Here we report our clinical observations in the management of SIOD in a patient who was diagnosed in school age despite early signs and symptoms. We describe biallelic variants, including a previously unreported c.1931G>A (p.Arg644Gln) variant in SMARCAL1. We specifically investigated whether migraine-like headaches and progressive nephropathy may be related to blood pressure dysregulation. We found a correlation between tighter blood pressure regulation using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and a subjective decrease in headache symptoms. We discuss blood pressure medication management in SIOD. We also characterize dyslipidemia relative to atherosclerosis risks and provide new management strategies to consider for optimizing care.CI - © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",

      "PMID:  30607898\n",
      "Abs: Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by symmetrical and bilateral brain calcification. It is typically inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder, and de novo variants have also been described. Interestingly, just recent studies have reported the first autosomal recessive PFBC-causative gene. PFBC patients exhibit high clinical heterogeneity including Parkinsonism, dystonia, ataxia, depression, and migraine. Mice studies, an important research tool, have been a breakthrough in increasing the understanding of PFBC's main signs and symptoms, and many findings reported in these mice have been subsequently reported in patients. One phenotype that has been observed in PFBC mice models but not in PFBC patients, however, is the development of ophthalmic abnormalities. This way, this report focused on performing an ophthalmic assessment in six Brazilian patients genetically diagnosed with PFBC. The assessments showed that none of the PFBC individuals included presented any of the ophthalmic abnormalities reported in mice models, such as cataracts, ocular calcification, abnormal iris and lens morphology, and retinal deterioration. Additionally, of the six PFBC patients described, two SLC20A2 mutation carriers showed physiological excavation of the optic nerve head and partial vitreous detachment, while just one individual presented bilateral narrowing of retinal arterioles. In summary, no evidence of similar ophthalmological abnormalities found in mice were found in our patients; nonetheless, further studies in larger sample size are warranted to corroborate with our findings. To our knowledge, this study is the first to focus on investigating, in PFBC patients, the ophthalmological phenotypes described in the PFBC mice models.\n",

      "PMID:  29056066\n",
      "Abs: CONTEXT: Monoclonal antibodies are being investigated for chronic pain to overcome the shortcomings of current treatment options. OBJECTIVE: To provide a practical overview of monoclonal antibodies in clinical development for use in chronic pain conditions, with a focus on mechanisms of action and relevance to specific classes. METHODS: Qualitative review using a systematic strategy to search for randomized controlled trials, systematic and nonsystematic (narrative) reviews, observational studies, nonclinical studies, and case reports for inclusion. Studies were identified via relevant search terms using an electronic search of MEDLINE via PubMed (1990 to June 2017) in addition to hand-searching reference lists of retrieved systematic and nonsystematic reviews. RESULTS: Monoclonal antibodies targeting nerve growth factor, calcitonin gene-related peptide pathways, various ion channels, tumor necrosis factor-α, and epidermal growth factor receptor are in different stages of development. Mechanisms of action are dependent on specific signaling pathways, which commonly involve those related to peripheral neurogenic inflammation. In clinical studies, there has been a mixed response to different monoclonal antibodies in several chronic pain conditions, including migraine, neuropathic pain conditions (e.g., diabetic peripheral neuropathy), osteoarthritis, chronic back pain, ankylosing spondylitis, and cancer. Adverse events observed to date have generally been mild, although further studies are needed to ensure safety of monoclonal antibodies in early stages of development, especially where there is an overlap with non-pain-related pathways. High acquisition cost remains another treatment limitation. CONCLUSION: Monoclonal antibodies for chronic pain have the potential to overcome the limitations of current treatment options, but strategies to ensure their appropriate use need to be determined.\n",

      "PMID:  21673957\n",
      "Abs: Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is associated with clinical conditions including cryptogenic stroke, migraine and varicose veins. Data from studies in humans and mouse suggest that PFO and the secundum form of atrial septal defect (ASDII) exist in an anatomical continuum of septal dysmorphogenesis with a common genetic basis. Mutations in multiple members of the evolutionarily conserved cardiac transcription factor network, including GATA4, cause or predispose to ASDII and PFO. Here, we assessed whether the most prevalent variant of the GATA4 gene, S377G, was significantly associated with PFO or ASD. Our analysis of world indigenous populations showed that GATA4 S377G was largely Caucasian-specific, and so subjects were restricted to those of Caucasian descent. To select for patients with larger PFO, we limited our analysis to those with cryptogenic stroke in which PFO was a subsequent finding. In an initial study of Australian subjects, we observed a weak association between GATA4 S377G and PFO/Stroke relative to Caucasian controls in whom ASD and PFO had been excluded (OR = 2.16; p = 0.02). However, in a follow up study of German Caucasians no association was found with either PFO or ASD. Analysis of combined Australian and German data confirmed the lack of a significant association. Thus, the common GATA4 variant S377G is likely to be relatively benign in terms of its participation in CHD and PFO/Stroke.\n",

      "Abs: Drug studies in animal models have implicated pannexin1 (Panx1) in various types of pain, including trigeminal hypersensitivity, neuropathic pain and migraine. However, the tested drugs have limited specificity and efficacy so that direct evidence for Panx1 contribution to pain has been lacking. We here show that tactile hypersensitivity is markedly attenuated by deletion of Panx1 in a mouse model of chronic orofacial pain; in this model, trigeminal ganglion Panx1 expression and function are markedly enhanced. Targeted deletion of Panx1 in GFAP-positive glia or in neurons revealed distinct effects. Panx1 deletion in GFAP-positive glia cells prevented hypersensitivity completely, whereas deletion of neuronal Panx1 reduced baseline sensitivity and the duration of hypersensitivity. In trigeminal ganglia with genetically encoded Ca(2+) indicator in GFAP-positive glia or in neurons, both cell populations were found to be hyperactive and hyper-responsive to ATP. These novel findings reveal unique roles for GFAP-positive glial and neuronal Panx1 and describe new chronic pain targets for cell-type specific intervention in this often intractable disease.\n",

      "Abs: Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) is associated with migraine pathophysiology, stroke recovery and vasospasm treatment. The potential vascular interplay of PDE5 inhibitors sildenafil, tadalafil and UK-114,542 was studied by intra- versus extra-luminal administration in rat middle cerebral arteries in vitro and on middle meningeal arteries in vivo. By Western blot PDE5 was detected in both cerebral and meningeal arteries, though with minor variations in band intensity between vascular beds. Rat middle cerebral artery diameter was investigated using pressurised arteriography, applying UK-114,542, sildenafil, and tadalafil intra- or extra-luminally. Effects on the dural middle meningeal artery were studied in the in vivo closed cranial window model. At high concentrations, abluminal sildenafil and UK-114,542, but not tadalafil, induced dilatation of the middle cerebral artery. Luminal application elicited a contraction of 4% (sildenafil, P=0.03) and 10% (tadalafil, P=0.02). In vivo, sildenafil, but not tadalafil, dose-dependently dilated middle meningeal artery concomitant to blood pressure reduction (1-3mg/kg);1mg/kg sildenafil inducing 60 ± 14% (P=0.04) and vehicle (DMSO) 13 ± 6% dilatation. In conclusion, PDE5 inhibitors applied luminally had minor contractile effect, whereas abluminal sildenafil induced middle cerebral artery dilatation above therapeutic levels. In vivo, sildenafil dilated middle meningeal artery concomitant with a reduction in blood pressure. Tadalafil had no dilatory effects. PDE5 inhibitors show differential vascular activity in cerebral arteries from healthy animals; arterial dilatation is seen primarily above therapeutic levels. Such findings support clinical studies showing no vasodilator effects of sildenafil on cerebral arteries in healthy subjects.CI - Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "PMID:  28572046\n",
      "Abs: The extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) region is the most conserved of the three ECL domains in family B G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and has a fundamental role in ligand binding and activation across the receptor super-family. ECL2 is fundamental for ligand-induced activation of the calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) receptor, a family B GPCR implicated in migraine and heart disease. In this study we apply a comprehensive targeted non-alanine substitution analysis method and molecular modelling to the functionally important residues of ECL2 to reveal key molecular interactions. We identified an interaction network between R274/Y278/D280/W283. These amino acids had the biggest reduction in signalling following alanine substitution analysis and comprise a group of basic, acidic and aromatic residues conserved in the wider calcitonin family of class B GPCRs. This study identifies key and varied constraints at each locus, including diverse biochemical requirements for neighbouring tyrosine residues and a W283H substitution that recovered wild-type (WT) signalling, despite the strictly conserved nature of the central ECL2 tryptophan and the catastrophic effects on signalling of W283A substitution. In contrast, while the distal end of ECL2 requires strict conservation of hydrophobicity or polarity in each position, mutation of these residues never has a large effect. This approach has revealed linked networks of amino acids, consistent with structural models of ECL2 and likely to represent a shared structural framework at an important ligand-receptor interface that is present across the family B GPCRs.CI - Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

      "PMID:  15265053\n",
      "Abs: BIBN 4096 BS ([R-(R*,S*)]-N-[2-[[5-amino-1-[[4-(4-pyridinyl)-1-piperazinyl]carbonyl]pentyl]amino]-1-[(3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxyphenyl)methyl]-2-oxoethyl]-4-(1,4-dihydro-2-oxo-3(2H)-quinazolinyl)-,1-piperidinecarboxamide) is the first selective, highly potent, small molecule, nonpeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, which has been developed for the treatment of acute migraine. The objective of this study was to obtain information on the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of BIBN 4096 BS following single intravenous administration of rising doses (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg) in 55 healthy male and female volunteers. The study was of single-centre, double-blind (within dose levels), placebo-controlled, randomized, single rising dose design. Blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, ECG, laboratory tests and forearm blood flow did not reveal any clinically relevant, drug-induced changes. Sixteen adverse events (AEs) were reported by eight of 41 volunteers after BIBN 4096 BS compared to five AEs reported by four of 14 volunteers after placebo. Approximately two-thirds of all AEs related to active treatment occurred at the highest dose of 10 mg. At this dose level, all AEs were confined to the three BIBN 4096 BS-treated females, and consisted mainly of transient and mild paresthesias. Paresthesias were the single most frequent AE, whereas fatigue was the AE which occurred in the highest number of subjects. Only two AEs were of moderate intensity, all remaining AEs were of mild intensity. No serious AEs were reported. The local tolerability after intravenous administration was good. In summary, intravenously administered BIBN 4096 BS revealed a very favourable safety profile over the dose range tested in both genders. Generally well tolerated at all dose levels, it was of satisfactory tolerability in female subjects at the highest dose of 10 mg. The plasma concentration-time courses of BIBN 4096 BS showed multicompartmental disposition characteristics. Mean maximum concentration (Cmax) values appeared to be dose-proportional. Based on the results from the two high dose levels (5 and 10 mg) with sufficient individual subject data, BIBN 4096 BS exhibited a total plasma clearance (CL) of approximately 12 l/h and an apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) of approximately 20 l, resulting in a terminal half-life (t1/2) of approximately 2.5 h. Inter-individual variability was moderate with a coefficient of variation of approximately 45% based on the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) values. The mean renal clearance (CLR) was approximately 2 l/h, suggesting that renal excretion plays only a minor role in the elimination of unchanged BIBN 4096 BS.\n",

      "Abs: P-type and Q-type calcium channels mediate neurotransmitter release at many synapses in the mammalian nervous system. The alpha 1A calcium channel has been implicated in the etiologies of conditions such as episodic ataxia, epilepsy and familial migraine, and shares several properties with native P- and Q-type channels. However, the exact relationship between alpha 1A and P- and Q-type channels is unknown. Here we report that alternative splicing of the alpha 1A subunit gene results in channels with distinct kinetic, pharmacological and modulatory properties. Overall, the results indicate that alternative splicing of the alpha 1A gene generates P-type and Q-type channels as well as multiple phenotypic variants.\n",

      "PMID:  25118028\n",
      "Abs: De novo monoallelic variants in NFIX cause two distinct syndromes. Whole gene deletions, nonsense variants and missense variants affecting the DNA-binding domain have been seen in association with a Sotos-like phenotype that we propose is referred to as Malan syndrome. Frameshift and splice-site variants thought to avoid nonsense-mediated RNA decay have been seen in Marshall-Smith syndrome. We report six additional patients with Malan syndrome and de novo NFIX deletions or sequence variants and review the 20 patients now reported. The phenotype is characterised by moderate postnatal overgrowth and macrocephaly. Median height and head circumference in childhood are 2.0 and 2.3 standard deviations (SD) above the mean, respectively. There is overlap of the facial phenotype with NSD1-positive Sotos syndrome in some cases including a prominent forehead, high anterior hairline, downslanting palpebral fissures and prominent chin. Neonatal feeding difficulties and/or hypotonia have been reported in 30% of patients. Developmental delay/learning disability have been reported in all cases and are typically moderate. Ocular phenotypes are common, including strabismus (65%), nystagmus (25% ) and optic disc pallor/hypoplasia (25%). Other recurrent features include pectus excavatum (40%) and scoliosis (25%). Eight reported patients have a deletion also encompassing CACNA1A, haploinsufficiency of which causes episodic ataxia type 2 or familial hemiplegic migraine. One previous case had episodic ataxia and one case we report has had cyclical vomiting responsive to pizotifen. In individuals with this contiguous gene deletion syndrome, awareness of possible later neurological manifestations is important, although their penetrance is not yet clear.\n",

      "Title: Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids are endogenous regulators of vasoactive neuropeptide release from trigeminal ganglion neurons\n",
      "PMID:  20950340\n",
      "Abs: Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are bioactive eicosanoids produced from arachidonic acid by cytochrome P450 epoxygenases. We previously described the expression of cytochrome P450-2J epoxygenase in rat trigeminal ganglion neurons and that EETs signaling is involved in cerebrovascular dilation resulting from perivascular nerve stimulation. In this study, we evaluate the presence of the EETs signaling pathway in trigeminal ganglion neurons and their role in modulating the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) by trigeminal ganglion neurons. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry identified the presence of each of the four EETs regio-isomers within primary trigeminal ganglion neurons. Stimulation for 1 h with the transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 channel agonist capsaicin (100 nmol/L) or depolarizing K(+) (60 mmol/L) increased CGRP release as measured by ELISA. Stimulation-evoked CGRP release was attenuated by 30 min pre-treatment with the EETs antagonist 14,15-epoxyeicosa-5(Z)-enoic acid (14,15-EEZE, 10 μmol/L). K(+) stimulation elevated CGRP release 2.9 ± 0.3-fold above control levels, whereas in the presence of 14,15-EEZE K(+)-evoked CGRP release was significantly reduced to 1.1 ± 0.2-fold above control release (p < 0.01 anova, n = 6). 14,15-EEZE likewise attenuated capsaicin-evoked CGRP release from trigeminal ganglion neurons (p < 0.05 anova, n = 6). Similarly, pre-treatment with the cytochrome P450 epoxygenase inhibitor attenuated stimulation-evoked CGRP release. These data demonstrate that EETs are endogenous constituents of rat trigeminal ganglion neurons and suggest that they may act as intracellular regulators of neuropeptide release, which may have important clinical implications for treatment of migraine, stroke and vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage.CI - © 2010 The Authors.

      "PMID:  17361120\n",
      "Abs: Only about 70% of migraine and cluster headache (CH) patients report significant treatment responses to triptans, which are agonists at 5-HT(1B/D) receptors belonging to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. We analyzed whether a common polymorphism in the gene for the G protein beta3 subunit (GNB3 C825T) modulates responder rates to triptans among a cohort of 231 unrelated Caucasian CH patients. A total of 180 CH patients used triptans, of whom 71.1% reported treatment success. The adjusted odds ratio for treatment response to triptans for heterozygous carriers of the GNB3 825T allele was 2.96 (95% confidence interval 1.34-6.56; P=0.0074) vs carriers of the 825CC genotype. The GNB3 genotype status did not affect responses to other acute and preventive therapeutic regimes including oxygen, verapamil, and corticosteroids, i.e., drugs not directly affecting G proteins. We conclude that pain relief by triptans is significantly modulated by a common genetic GNB3 variant.\n",

      "Title: [Hereditary angioedema in the German-speaking region]\n",
      "PMID:  9551333\n",
      "Abs: A multicentre, retrospective study of hereditary deficiency of C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) function, a deficiency which clinically manifests as hereditary angioedema (HAE), was performed in six centres in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. 242 individuals were registered with proven functional or quantitative deficiency of C1-INH who belonged to kindered with disease manifestation in 2 to 6 generations. Considering the total population in the three countries and the number of registered individuals, a frequency of the deficiency of 0.02 x 10(-4) was calculated. As this epidemiological study involved only 6 centres, a 10 to 100 times higher frequency of C1-INH deficiency is estimated to be a more realistic value. Out of the 242 registered individuals 110 were evaluated for type and location of clinical manifestation of the deficiency, the laboratory data and the therapy outcome. 86 (78.2%) of the patients belonged to the \"common type\" and 24 (21.8%) to the \"variant type\" of HAE. In 53.9% of the cases first manifestation of the disease was before the age of 20 years. In only 3.9% of the patient population did the disease begin after 40 years of age. A mean time lag of 5,3 years was observed, between the first manifestation and correct diagnosis. Initial diagnosis was correct in only 31.8% of the cases of which dermatologists provided 51.7%. False diagnoses include urticaria (41.3%), allergy (20%), acute abdomen (18.7%), angina (8%), rheumatoid disease (5.3%) and intracranial haemorrhage, CNS tumour, epilepsy, migraine (5.3%). The distribution pattern of HAE resembled that of intolerance reactions and pseudoallergies. Urticarial lesions were not associated with C1-INH deficiency. 24% of the patients had at least one episode of laryngeal edema. 40% of patients were unable to identify a trigger of edema formation. The others indicated as triggers trauma, hormonal changes, mental stress, insect stings and in a few cases food and drugs. Menstruation and oral contraceptives aggravated or made disease manifestations more frequent. In contrast, during pregnancy in many cases clinical manifestations improved and delivery posed no problems. The possibility of HAO is very much suggested by the tailure of edema to respond to classical anti-allergic therapy. Therapy of choice of acute attacks is C1-INH concentrate. No side reactions, antibody formation or virus transmission have been observed. For long term prophylaxis danazol, an attenuated androgen, or tranexamic acid, a protease inhibitor, was chosen. The daily dose of danazol should be kept as low as possible because of its anabolic, anti-estrogenic, anti-gestagenic, and anti-gonadotropic effects. Indeed, adverse reactions were observed in 41.7% of patients receiving danazol. Frequencies of adverse reactions were twice as common in women as in men. Adverse reactions were dose dependent and reversible except for one woman with irreversible deepening of her voice. Measuring C1r is a effective way to assess C1-INH function and monitor therapy.\n",

      "Abs: Fibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD) is &ldquo;an idiopathic, segmental, non-atherosclerotic and non-inflammatory disease of the musculature of arterial walls, leading to stenosis of small and medium-sized arteries&rdquo; (Persu, et al; 2014). FMD can lead to hypertension, arterial dissections, subarachnoid haemorrhage, stroke or mesenteric ischemia. The pathophysiology of the disease remains elusive. While familial cases are rare (<5%) in contemporary FMD registries, there is evidence in favour of the existence of multiple genetic factors involved in this vascular disease. Recent collaborative efforts allowed the identification of a first genetic locus associated with FMD. This intronic variant located in the phosphatase and actin regulator 1 gene (PHACTR1) may influence the transcription activity of the endothelin-1 gene (EDN1) located nearby on chromosome 6. Interestingly, the PHACTR1 locus has also been involved in vascular hypertrophy in normal subjects, carotid dissection, migraine and coronary artery disease. National and international registries of FMD patients, with deep and harmonised phenotypic and genetic characterisation, are expected to be instrumental to improve our understanding of the genetic basis and pathophysiology of this intriguing vascular disease.\n",

      "PMID:  29621539\n",
      "Abs: Amitriptyline (AMIT) is a compound widely prescribed for psychiatric and non-psychiatric conditions including depression, migraine, chronic pain, and anorexia. However, AMIT has been associated with risks of cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death since it can induce prolongation of the QT interval on the surface electrocardiogram and torsade de pointes ventricular arrhythmia. These complications have been attributed to the inhibition of the rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (I(Kr)). The slow delayed rectifier potassium current (I(Ks)) is the main repolarizing cardiac current when I(Kr) is compromised and it has an important role in cardiac repolarization at fast heart rates induced by an elevated sympathetic tone. Therefore, we sought to characterize the effects of AMIT on Kv7.1/KCNE1 and homomeric Kv7.1 channels expressed in HEK-293H cells. Homomeric Kv7.1 and Kv7.1/KCNE1 channels were inhibited by AMIT in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 values of 8.8 ± 2.1 μM and 2.5 ± 0.8 μM, respectively. This effect was voltage-independent for both homomeric Kv7.1 and Kv7.1/KCNE1 channels. Moreover, mutation of residues located on the P-loop and S6 domain along with molecular docking, suggest that T312, I337 and F340 are the most important molecular determinants for AMIT-Kv7.1 channel interaction. Our experimental findings and modeling suggest that AMIT preferentially blocks the open state of Kv7.1/KCNE1 channels by interacting with specific residues that were previously reported to be important for binding of other compounds, such as chromanol 293B and the benzodiazepine L7.CI - Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

      "PMID:  19180562\n",
      "Abs: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a hereditary disease affecting vascular smooth muscle cells of nearly all tissues. Clinical manifestations mainly concern the central nervous system with repeated TIA/stroke, migraine, psychiatric disturbances, and cognitive decline. Minor findings have been reported in muscle, nerve, and skin. CADASIL is due to NOTCH3 gene mutations. This gene has been identified as an up-regulator of c-FLIP, an inhibitor of Fas-ligand-induced apoptosis. The aim of this study was to assess the involvement of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in cells from 16 Italian CADASIL patients. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and fibroblasts from CADASIL patients were exposed to 2-deoxy-D-ribose (dRib), which induces apoptosis by oxidative stress. Apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry, agarose gel electrophoresis and fluorescence microscopy for caspase-3 activation, phosphatidylserine exposure and mitochondrial membrane depolarization. PBLs and fibroblasts from CADASIL patients showed a significantly higher response to dRib-induced apoptosis than those of controls. PBLs from CADASIL patients also showed a significantly higher percentage of apoptotic cells than PBLs from controls, even when cultured without dRib. The greater susceptibility of PBLs and fibroblasts from CADASIL patients to dRib-induced apoptosis suggests that NOTCH3 mutations are an important apoptotic trigger. Since PBLs from patients showed higher levels of apoptosis even in the absence of an apoptotic stimulus, cells from CADASIL patients appear to be physiologically prone to apoptotic cell death.\n",

      "PMID:  16814767\n",
      "Abs: Migraine is a disorder associated with increased plasma concentrations of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). CGRP, a neuropeptide released from activated trigeminal sensory nerves, dilates cranial blood vessels and transmits vascular nociception. Moreover, several antimigraine drugs inhibit the dural neurogenic vasodilatation to trigeminal stimulation. Hence, this study investigated in anaesthetized dogs the effects of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine, on the external carotid vasodilator responses to capsaicin, alpha-CGRP and acetylcholine. 1-min intracarotid infusions of capsaicin (10, 18, 30 and 56 microg/min), alpha-CGRP (0.1, 0.3, 1 and 3 microg/min) and acetylcholine (0.01, 0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 microg/min) produced dose-dependent increases in external carotid conductance without affecting blood pressure or heart rate. Interestingly, the carotid vasodilator responses to capsaicin, but not those to alpha-CGRP or acetylcholine, were partially inhibited after clonidine (total dose: 24.4 microg/kg, i.v.); in contrast, equivalent volumes of saline did not affect the responses to capsaicin, alpha-CGRP or acetylcholine. The inhibitory responses to clonidine were antagonized by i.v. administration of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonists rauwolscine (alpha(2A/2B/2C); 300 microg/kg), BRL44408 (alpha(2A); 1000 microg/kg) or MK912 (alpha(2C); 100 and 300 microg/kg), but not by imiloxan (alpha(2B); 1000 microg/kg). These results suggest that clonidine inhibits the external carotid vasodilator responses to capsaicin by peripheral trigeminovascular and/or central mechanisms; this inhibitory response to clonidine seems to be predominantly mediated by alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors and, to a much lesser extent, by alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors.\n",

      "PMID:  22841658\n",
      "Abs: It has been suggested that during a migraine attack trigeminal nerves release calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), producing central nociception and vasodilatation of cranial arteries, including the extracranial branches of the external carotid artery. Since trigeminal inhibition may prevent this vasodilatation, the present study has investigated the effects of intrathecal dihydroergotamine on the external carotid vasodilatation to capsaicin, α-CGRP and acetylcholine. Anaesthetized vagosympathectomized dogs were prepared to measure blood pressure, heart rate and external carotid conductance. A catheter was inserted into the right common carotid artery for the continuous infusion of phenylephrine (to restore the carotid vascular tone), whereas the corresponding thyroid artery was cannulated for one-min intracarotid infusions of capsaicin, α-CGRP and acetylcholine (which dose-dependently increased the external carotid conductance). Another cannula was inserted intrathecally (C(1)-C(3)) for the administration of dihydroergotamine, the α(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist rauwolscine or the serotonin 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor antagonist GR127935 (N-[4-methoxy-3-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl) phenyl]-2'-methyl-4'-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)[1,1-biphenyl]-4-carboxamide hydrochloride monohydrate). Intrathecal dihydroergotamine (10, 31 and 100μg) inhibited the vasodilatation to capsaicin, but not that to α-CGRP or acetylcholine. This inhibition was: (i) unaffected by 10μg GR127935 or 100μg rauwolscine, but abolished by 31μg GR127935 or 310μg rauwolscine at 10μg dihydroergotamine; and (ii) abolished by the combination 10μg GR127935+100μg rauwolscine at 100μg dihydroergotamine. Thus, intrathecal (C(1)-C(3)) dihydroergotamine seems to inhibit the external carotid vasodilatation to capsaicin by spinal activation of serotonin 5-HT(1B/1D) (probably 5-HT(1B)) receptors and α(2) (probably α(2A/2C))-adrenoceptors.CI - Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

      "Title: TRPA1 receptors mediate environmental irritant-induced meningeal vasodilatation\n",
      "PMID:  21075522\n",
      "Abs: The TRPA1 receptor is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels expressed in nociceptive neurons. TRPA1 receptors are targeted by pungent compounds from mustard and garlic and environmental irritants such as formaldehyde and acrolein. Ingestion or inhalation of these chemical agents causes irritation and burning in the nasal and oral mucosa and respiratory lining. Headaches have been widely reported to be induced by inhalation of environmental irritants, but it is unclear how these agents produce headache. Stimulation of trigeminal neurons releases CGRP and substance P and induces neurogenic inflammation associated with the pain of migraine. Here we test the hypothesis that activation of TRPA1 receptors is the mechanistic link between environmental irritants and peptide-mediated neurogenic inflammation. Known TRPA1 agonists and environmental irritants stimulate CGRP release from dissociated rat trigeminal ganglia neurons and this release is blocked by a selective TRPA1 antagonist, HC-030031. Further, TRPA1 agonists and environmental irritants increase meningeal blood flow following intranasal administration. Prior dural application of the CGRP antagonist, CGRP(8-37), or intranasal or dural administration of HC-030031, blocks the increases in blood flow elicited by environmental irritants. Together these results demonstrate that TRPA1 receptor activation by environmental irritants stimulates CGRP release and increases cerebral blood flow. We suggest that these events contribute to headache associated with environmental irritants.CI - Copyright © 2010 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B.V.

      "PMID:  19460365\n",
      "Abs: Migraine is a neurovascular disorder associated with trigeminal activation, vasodilatation and trigeminal release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). The antimigraine properties of triptans may be due to: i) vasoconstriction of the carotid arterial bed via 5-HT(1B) receptors; and ii) inhibition of CGRP release from trigeminal nerves, via 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors. This study investigated the effects of intrathecally administered sumatriptan (a 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist) and PNU-142633 (a 5-HT(1D) receptor agonist) on the canine external carotid vasodilator responses to capsaicin, alpha-CGRP and acetylcholine. For this purpose, 42 mongrel dogs were anaesthetised with sodium pentobarbitone and, subsequently, vagosympathectomized. The animals were prepared to measure arterial blood pressure, heart rate and external carotid blood flow; the thyroid artery was cannulated for infusion of agonists. 1-min intracarotid (i.c.) continuous infusions of capsaicin, alpha-CGRP and acetylcholine produced dose-dependent increases in external carotid blood flow without affecting arterial blood pressure or heart rate. These vasodilator responses remained unaffected after intrathecal (i.t.) administration of physiological saline (0.5 ml) or PNU-142633 (300-1000 microg); in contrast, i.t. sumatriptan (300-1000 microg) significantly inhibited the vasodilator responses to capsaicin, but not those to alpha-CGRP or acetylcholine. Furthermore, i.t. administration of SB224289 (a 5-HT(1B) receptor antagonist), but not of BRL15572 (a 5-HT(1D) receptor antagonist), abolished the above inhibition by sumatriptan. These results suggest that sumatriptan-induced inhibition of the external carotid vasodilatation to capsaicin involves a central mechanism mainly mediated by 5-HT(1B) receptors.\n",

      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) has been used as an analgesic for myofascial pain syndromes, migraine, and other types of headaches. Although an antinociceptive effect of central or peripheral administration of BoNT/A is suggested, the effect at the spinal level is still unclear. In this study, we evaluated the antinociceptive effect of intrathecally administered BoNT/A on the ICR mice during the formalin test. METHODS: BoNT/A (0.01 U/mouse) was injected intrathecally in ICR mice, and we observed formalin-induced inflammatory pain behaviors at days 1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 after the injection. We also examined the level of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), phosphorylated extracellullar signal-regulated kinases (p-ERK), and phosphorylated Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type 2 (p-CaMK-II) using immunoblot or immunohistochemical analyses before and after BoNT/A intrathecal injection. RESULTS: Even a single intrathecal injection of BoNT/A significantly decreased the nociceptive responses in the first phase (10 and 14 days later) and in the second phase of the formalin test at 1, 4, 7, 10, and 14 days later (P < 0.05) without any locomotor changes. Interestingly, intrathecal BoNT/A attenuated the expression level of CGRP, p-ERK, and p-CaMK-II in the 4th and 5th lumbar spinal dorsal horn at 10 days after injection in comparison with control. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that intrathecally administered BoNT/A may have a central analgesic effect on inflammatory pain through the modulation of central sensitization. BoNT/A, with its long-lasting antinociceptive effect, may be a useful analgesic in inflammatory pain.\n",

      "Title: Linkage analysis and disease models in benign familial infantile seizures: a study of 16 families\n",
      "PMID:  16822249\n",
      "Abs: PURPOSE: Benign familial infantile seizures (BFIS) is a genetically heterogeneous condition characterized by partial seizures, onset age from 3 to 9 months, and favorable outcome. BFIS loci were identified on chromosomes 19q12-13.1 and 16p12-q12, allelic to infantile convulsions and choreathetosis. The identification of SCN2A mutations in families with only infantile seizures indicated that BFNIS and BFIS may show overlapping clinical features. Infantile seizures also were in a family with familial hemiplegic migraine and mutations in the ATP1A2 gene. We have examined the heterogeneous genetics of BFIS by means of linkage analysis. METHODS: Sixteen families were examined. Probands underwent neurologic examination, at least one EEG recording, and, when possible, brain CT and MRI. Clinical information about relatives was collected. Families with SCN2A or ATP1A2 mutations were excluded from the study. Chromosome 16p and 19q loci were examined by linkage analysis using two models that differed in penetrance rate. Genetic heterogeneity was evaluated with both models. RESULTS: Clinical information was available for 124 members of affected families. BFIS was diagnosed in 69 subjects. One patient without BFIS had a single febrile seizure, and another had rare episodes of paroxysmal dystonia. Evidence of linkage was obtained only for chromosome 16. Moreover, the high penetrance allowed the identification of genetic heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm the relevance of the chromosome 16 locus in BFIS and suggest the presence of an additional locus. This study shows that the genetic model used affects the outcome of linkage analysis.\n",

      "Title: Potassium channel blockers and openers as CNS neurologic therapeutic agents\n",
      "PMID:  18221232\n",
      "Abs: Potassium (K+) channels are the most heterogeneous and widely distributed class of ion channels. K(+) channels are dynamic pore-forming transmembrane proteins known to play important roles in all cell types underlying both normal and pathophysiological functions. Essential for such diverse physiological processes as nerve impulse propagation, muscle contraction, cellular activation and the secretion of biologically active molecules, various K(+) channels are recognized as potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, stroke, brain tumors, brain/spinal cord ischemia, pain and schizophrenia, migraine, as well as cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension, diabetes, cervical cancer, urological diseases and sepsis. In addition to their importance as therapeutic targets, certain K(+) channels are gaining attention for their beneficial roles in anesthesia, neuroprotection and cardioprotection. The K(+) channel gene families (subdividing into multiple subfamilies) include voltage-gated (K(v): K(v)1-K(v)12 or KCNA-KCND, KCNF-KCNH, KCNQ, KCNS), calcium-activated (K(Ca): K(Ca)1-K(Ca)5 or KCNM-KCNN), inwardly rectifying (K(ir): K(ir)1-K(ir)7 or KCNJ) and background/leak or tandem 2-pore (K(2P): K(2P)1-K(2P)7, K(2P)9-K(2P)10, K(2P)12-K(2P)13, K(2P)15-K(2P)18 or KCNK) K(+) channels. Worldwide, the pharmaceutical industry is actively developing better strategies for targeting ion channels, in general, and K(+) channels, in particular, already generating over $6 billion in sales per annum from drugs designed to block or modulate ion channel function. This review provides an overview of recent patents on emerging K(+) channel blockers and activators (openers) with potential for development as new and improved nervous system therapeutic agents.\n",

      "PMID:  12023327\n",
      "Abs: There is a considerable literature to suggest that adenosine A1 receptor agonists may have anti-nociceptive effects, and we sought to explore the role of adenosine A1 receptors in a model of trigeminovascular nociceptive transmission. Cats were anaesthetized (alpha-chloralose 60 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), and prepared for physiological monitoring. The superior sagittal sinus (SSS) was stimulated electrically, and linked units were recorded in the trigeminocervical complex. Post-stimulus histograms were constructed to analyse the responses and the effect of drug administration. Blood was sampled from the external jugular vein to determine levels of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release before and after drug administration. Intravenous administration of the highly selective adenosine A1 receptor agonist, GR79236 (3-100 microg/kg) had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on SSS-evoked trigeminal activity. The maximal effect (80 +/- 6% reduction in probability of firing) was seen at 100 microg/kg. The neuronal inhibitory effect of GR79236 could be inhibited by the selective adenosine A1 receptor antagonist DPCPX (300 microg/kg; P < 0.05). SSS stimulation increased cranial CGRP levels from 33 +/- 2 pmol/l (n = 6) to 64 +/- 3 pmol/l, an effect substantially reduced by pre-treatment with GR79236 (30 microg/kg; P < 0.01). The selective low efficacy adenosine A1 receptor agonist, GR190178 (30-1000 microg/kg i.v.), also inhibited SSS-evoked neuronal activity in a dose-dependent fashion. In this model of trigeminovascular nociception, adenosine A1 receptor activation leads to neuronal inhibition without concomitant vasoconstriction, suggesting a novel avenue for the treatment of migraine and cluster headache.\n",

      "PMID:  25660390\n",
      "Abs: Mutations in the polymerase gamma-1 (POLG1) gene, encoding the catalytic subunit of the mtDNA-specific polymerase-γ, compromise the stability of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and are responsible for numerous clinical presentations as autosomal dominant or recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), sensory ataxia, neuropathy, dysarthria and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO), spinocerebellar ataxia with epilepsy (SCAE) and Alpers syndrome. POLG1 mutations result in extremely heterogeneous phenotypes which often have overlapping clinical findings, making it difficult to categorize patients into syndromes, and genotype-phenotype correlations are still unclear. We describe a new family with a particular spectrum of clinical signs, that carried the c.752C>T mutation in exon 3 (T251I) and the c.1760C>T in exon 10 (P587L) in cis. These mutations were associated in the proband and in her brother with the new probably pathogenic mutation c.347C>A in exon 2 (P116Q). The proband presented a progressive cognitive impairment, mild myopathy, dilated cardiac right atrium and posterior white matter mild signal alteration, while her brother had migraine, mild myopathy, palpebral ptosis and posterior white matter mild signal alteration. Their mother and their sister carried the in cis T251I and the P587L mutations. The first presented neurosensorial hypoacusia, fatigue, heart block and a cerebral arteriovenous malformation nidus, while the latter had borderline intellectual functioning and signs of muscular involvement. Their father, with the P116Q mutation, had diabetes and myopathy. The complexity of the genotype-phenotype correlations associated with POLG1 mutations is reinforced in this work as evidenced by the presence of different clinic features in patients carrying the same mutations.CI - Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

      "PMID:  11478927\n",
      "Abs: 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is implicated in migraine and agonist directed against 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(1D) receptors are commonly used as effective therapies. The antimigraine mechanisms involve the inhibition of intracranial sensory neuropeptide release. In order to determine which 5-HT(1) receptor subtypes are involved we have by immunocytochemistry examined the distribution of 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(1D) receptors in the human trigeminal ganglia, and addressed which of them colocalize with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP) or nitric oxide synthase (NOS). We detected that 5-HT(1D) receptor immunoreactivity (i.r.) was predominantly expressed in medium-sized cells (86% of positive cells, 30-60 microm). About 9% of the 5-HT(1D) receptor i.r. cells were large in size (> 60 microm) and 5% were small in size (< 30 microm). In a similar pattern, 5-HT(1B) receptor i.r. was mainly expressed in medium-sized cells (81% in 30-60 microm, 15% in > 60 microm and 4% in < 30 microm). Double immunostaining was used to determine whether the 5-HT(1B) or 5-HT(1D) receptor immunoreactive cells co-localized with either CGRP, SP or NOS. Thus, 89% of the CGRP i.r. cells expressed 5-HT(1D) receptor i.r. and 65% of the CGRP positive cells were 5-HT(1B) receptor positive. Most of the 5-HT(1D) (95%) and the 5-HT(1B) (94%) receptor i.r. cells showed SP immunostaining and 83% of 5-HT(1D) receptor and 86% of 5-HT(1B) receptor i.r. cells contained NOS. In conclusion, both 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(1D) receptors are expressed in the human trigeminal ganglion and they are mainly localized in medium-sized cells and they seem to colocalize with CGRP, SP and NOS.\n",

      "PMID:  27377707\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Neurogenic inflammation has for decades been considered an important part of migraine pathophysiology. In the present study, we asked the question if administration of a novel kynurenic acid analogue (SZR72), precursor of an excitotoxin antagonist and anti-inflammatory substance, can modify the neurogenic inflammatory response in the trigeminal ganglion. METHODS: Inflammation in the trigeminal ganglion was induced by local dural application of Complete Freunds Adjuvant (CFA). Levels of phosphorylated MAP kinase pERK1/2 and IL-1β expression in V1 region of the trigeminal ganglion were investigated using immunohistochemistry and Western blot. FINDINGS: Pretreatment with one dose of SZR72 abolished the CFA-induced pERK1/2 and IL-1β activation in the trigeminal ganglion. No significant change was noted in case of repeated treatment with SZR72 as compared to a single dose. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that demonstrates that one dose of KYNA analog before application of CFA can give anti-inflammatory response in a model of trigeminal activation, opening a new line for further investigations regarding possible effects of KYNA derivates.\n",

      "Title: The mouse 5-hydroxytryptamine1B receptor is localized predominantly on axon terminals\n",
      "PMID:  8159291\n",
      "Abs: The 5-hydroxytryptamine1B receptor is a serotonin receptor subtype which is expressed predominantly in the basal ganglia. It has been suggested to play a role in movement and appetite control as well as in certain pathological states such as migraine. The recent cloning of the 5-hydroxytryptamine1B gene as well as the discovery of a radioligand that labels in rodents 5-hydroxytryptamine1B and possibly 5-hydroxytryptamine1D alpha receptors (S-CM-G[125I]TNH2) allowed us to compare the distribution of the messenger RNA and of the protein in mouse brain sections. A high 5-hydroxytryptamine1B messenger RNA level is found in the caudate-putamen in medium spiny neurons that project to the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra. In contrast, no messenger RNA is expressed in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra although these structures reveal the highest level of 5-hydroxytryptamine1B binding sites. In the hippocampus, 5-hydroxytryptamine1B messenger RNA is localized in the cell bodies of pyramidal cells of the CA1 field while the protein is found predominantly in the dorsal subiculum, a projection zone for the CA1 pyramidal neurons. In the cerebellum, 5-hydroxytryptamine1B messenger RNA is expressed in the Purkinje cells, which display no receptor binding sites. Conversely, moderate binding is found in the deep nuclei of the cerebellum, the main projection zone of the Purkinje cells. 5-Hydroxytryptamine1B sites are also detected in the superficial gray layer of the superior colliculus and the lateral geniculate nucleus, brain regions containing the terminals of retinal ganglion cells. The soma of these ganglion cells express high levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine1B messenger RNA while no 5-hydroxytryptamine1B binding sites were found in the retina. This study demonstrates that the main brain regions, expressing 5-hydroxytrypamine1B messenger RNA contain low densities of 5-hydroxytryptamine1B binding sites. Conversely, the major projection areas of these anatomical structures do not express detectable levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine1B messenger RNA, but present a high density of binding sites. In addition, our data suggest that the distribution of the 5-hydroxytryptamine1D alpha binding sites is different from that of the 5-hydroxytryptamine1D alpha messenger RNA. These results together with previous lesion studies, indicate that the 5-hydroxytryptamine1B and possibly the 5-hydroxytryptamine1D alpha receptors are localized predominantly on axon terminals, while their expression is low or absent at the somatodendritic level. The 5-hydroxytryptamine1D alpha proteins might therefore contain an addressing signal allowing their transport toward nerve endings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\n",

      "PMID:  12106694\n",
      "Abs: We have cloned and expressed the full-length human Na(V)1.6 sodium channel cDNA. Northern analysis showed that the hNa(V)1.6 gene, like its rodent orthologues, is abundantly expressed in adult brain but not other tissues including heart and skeletal muscle. Within the adult brain, hNa(V)1.6 mRNA is widely expressed with particularly high levels in the cerebellum, occipital pole and frontal lobe. When stably expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293), the hNa(V)1.6 channel was found to be very similar in its biophysical properties to human Na(V)1.2 and Na(V)1.3 channels [Eur. J. Neurosci. 12 (2000) 4281-4289; Pflügers Arch. 441 (2001) 425-433]. Only relatively subtle differences were observed, for example, in the voltage dependence of gating. Like hNa(V)1.3 channels, hNa(V)1.6 produced sodium currents with a prominent persistent component when expressed in HEK293 cells. These persistent currents were similar to those reported for the rat Na(V)1.2 channel [Neuron 19 (1997) 443-452], although they were not dependent on over-expression of G protein betagamma subunits. These data are consistent with the proposal that Na(V)1.6 channels may generate the persistent currents observed in cerebellar Purkinje neurons [J. Neurosci. 17 (1997) 4157-4536]. However, in our hNa(V)1.6 cell line we have been unable to detect the resurgent currents that have also been described in Purkinje cells. Although Na(V)1.6 channels have been implicated in producing these resurgent currents [Neuron 19 (1997) 881-891], our data suggest that this may require modification of the Na(V)1.6 alpha subunit by additional factors found in Purkinje neurons but not in HEK293 cells.CI - Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.\n",

      "PMID:  21929659\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of chronic morphine exposure on diffuse noxious inhibitory controls in a large population of neurons throughout the medullary dorsal horn, as assessed using immunocytochemistry for c-Fos protein. BACKGROUND: Overuse of medications, including the opioids, to treat migraine headache can lead to progressively more frequent headaches. In addition, chronic daily headache sufferers and chronic opioid users both lack the inhibition of pain produced by noxious stimulation of a distal body region, often referred to as diffuse noxious inhibitory controls. METHODS: In urethane anesthetized rats, Fos-positive neurons were quantified in chronic morphine and vehicle-treated animals following 52°C noxious thermal stimulation of the cornea with and without the application of a spatially remote noxious stimulus (placement of the tail in 55°C water). RESULTS: When compared to chronic morphine-treated animals that did not receive the spatially remote noxious stimulus, chronic morphine-treated animals given corneal stimulation along with the spatially remote noxious stimulus demonstrated a 163% increase (P < .05) in the number of Fos-positive neurons in the superficial laminae of the medullary dorsal horn and a 682% increase (P < .01) in deep laminae that was restricted to the side ipsilateral to the applied stimulus. In contrast, no significant difference was found in Fos-like immunoreactivity in vehicle-treated animals given concurrent cornea and tail stimulation or only cornea stimulation in either superficial or deep laminae. CONCLUSIONS: It is proposed that an increase in descending facilitation and subsequent loss of diffuse noxious inhibitory controls contributes to the development of medication overuse headache.CI - © 2011 American Headache Society.\n",

      "PMID:  21632761\n",
      "Abs: TRIM5α is a restriction factor that can block an early step in the retroviral life cycle by recognizing and causing the disassembly of incoming viral capsids, thereby preventing the completion of reverse transcription. Numerous other isoforms of human TRIM5 exist, and isoforms lacking a C-terminal SPRY domain can inhibit the activity of TRIM5α. Thus, TRIM5α activity in a given cell type could be dependent on the relative proportions of TRIM5 isoforms expressed, but little information concerning the relative expression of TRIM5 isoforms in human cells is available. In this study, we demonstrate that mRNAs coding for TRIM5α represent only 50% of total TRIM5 transcripts in human cell lines, CD4(+) T cells, and macrophages. Transcripts coding for, in order of abundance, TRIM5ι (TRIM5-iota), a previously uncharacterized isoform, TRIM5γ, TRIM5δ, and TRIM5κ are also present. Like TRIM5γ and TRIM5δ, TRIM5ι and TRIM5κ do not inhibit HIV-1 replication, but both have dominant-negative activity against TRIM5α. Specific knockdown of TRIM5ι increases TRIM5α activity in human U373-X4 cells, indicating that physiological levels of expression of truncated TRIM5 isoforms in human cells can reduce the activity of TRIM5α.\n",

      "Abs: INTRODUCTION: Ewing sarcoma (ES) as a primary intracranial tumor is very rare. Recently, CNS embryonal tumors with ES-like genomic change have been reported. Patients and methods We report a case of intracranial Ewing sarcoma in a 13-year-old girl who complained of headache and migraine. The tumor had developed in the right middle cranial fossa with a mass effect on the brain with impending transuncal herniation. RESULTS: Undifferentiated small round cell morphology with completely negative results for friend leukemia integration 1 transcription factor (Fli-1) and a nonspecific cytoplasmic CD99-positive staining pattern mislead the diagnosis as central nervous system (CNS) embryonal tumor, NOS. However, whole genome sequencing (WGS) revealed Ewing sarcoma (EWS)-Fli-1 gene fusion, which was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization study and the diagnosis was revised to ES. CONCLUSIONS: This case is a true intracranial but extra-axial ES confirmed by WGS. We report this case of intracranial ES to demonstrate the importance of marker gene studies using FISH or NGS.\n",

      "PMID:  23935248\n",
      "Abs: Inflammatory damage plays an important role in cerebral ischemic pathogenesis and may represent a target for treatment. Parthenolide (PN) has been proved to elicit a wide range of biological activities through its anti-inflammatory action in the treatment of migraine, arthritis, and atherosclerosis. To decide whether this effect applies to ischemic injury in brain, we therefore investigate the potential neuroprotective role of PN and the underlying mechanisms. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into Saline, Vehicle, and PN groups and a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was used. PN administered intraperitoneally immediately after cerebral ischemia and once daily on the following days. At time points after MCAO, neurological deficit, infarct volume, and brain water content were measured. Immunohistochemistry, western blot and RT-PCR were used to analyze the expression of NF- κ B and caspase-1 in ischemic brain tissue. Phospho-p38MAPK and claudin-5 were detected by western blot. The results indicated that PN dramatically ameliorated neurological deficit, brain water content, and infarct volume, downregulated NF- κ B, phospho-p38MAPK, and caspase-1 expressions, and upregulated claudin-5 expression in ischemic brain tissue. CONCLUSIONS: PN protected the brain from damage caused by MCAO; this effect may be through downregulating NF- κ B, phosho-p38MAPK, and caspase-1 expressions and ameliorating BBB permeability.\n",

      "PMID:  24462621\n",
      "Abs: Environmental exposure to lead (Pb) early in life results in a latent upregulation of genes and products associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), particularly the plaque forming protein amyloid beta (Aβ). Furthermore, animals exposed to Pb as infants develop cognitive decline and memory impairments in old age. Studies from our lab demonstrated that tolfenamic acid lowers the levels of the amyloid β precursor protein (APP) and its aggregative cleavage product Aβ by inducing the degradation of the transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1). These changes were accompanied by cognitive improvement in transgenic APP knock-in mice. In this study, we examined the effects of tolfenamic acid on beta site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) which is responsible for Aβ production and tested its ability to reverse Pb-induced upregulation in the amyloidogenic pathway. Mice were administered tolfenamic acid for one month and BACE1 gene expression as well as its enzymatic activity were analyzed in the cerebral cortex. Tolfenamic acid was also tested for its ability to reverse changes in Sp1, APP and Aβ that were upregulated by Pb in vitro. Differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were either left unexposed, or sequentially exposed to Pb followed by tolfenamic acid. Our results show that tolfenamic acid reduced BACE1 gene expression and enzyme activity in mice. In neuroblastoma cells, Pb upregulated Sp1, APP and Aβ, while tolfenamic acid lowered their expression. These results along with previous data from our lab provide evidence that tolfenamic acid, a drug that has been used for decades for migraine, represents a candidate which can reduce the pathology of AD and may mitigate the damage of environmental risk factors associated with this disease.CI - Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

      "PMID:  21928368\n",
      "Abs: Feverfew is the most commonly used medicinal herb against migraine headache. The antimigraine mechanism of feverfew supercritical extract was investigated in vitro using the mouse macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7). Mouse macrophage cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide in the presence and absence of feverfew extracts. Inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide and TNF-α synthesis were quantified by ELISA. The mRNA and protein expression of iNOS and eNOS genes were analysed by RT-PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. The feverfew extract inhibited both nitric oxide (NO) and TNF-α production in a dose-dependent manner with complete inhibition of NO occurring at 5 µg/mL of feverfew extract. Both eNOS and iNOS mRNA levels were unchanged with the feverfew treatment. However, eNOS and iNOS proteins were significantly down-regulated by the feverfew extract. Feverfew inhibition of NO is due to the down-regulation of both eNOS and iNOS enzymes at the translational and/or post-translational level.CI - Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n",

      "PMID:  23028470\n",
      "Abs: Melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are the only functional photoreceptive cells in the eye of newborn mice. Through postnatal day 9, in the absence of functional rods and cones, these ipRGCs mediate a robust avoidance behavior to a light source, termed negative phototaxis. To determine whether this behavior is associated with an aversive experience in neonatal mice, we characterized light-induced vocalizations and patterns of neuronal activation in regions of the brain involved in the processing of aversive and painful stimuli. Light evoked distinct melanopsin-dependent ultrasonic vocalizations identical to those emitted under stressful conditions, such as isolation from the litter. In contrast, light did not evoke the broad-spectrum calls elicited by acute mechanical pain. Using markers of neuronal activation, we found that light induced the immediate-early gene product Fos in the posterior thalamus, a brain region associated with the enhancement of responses to mechanical stimulation of the dura by light, and thought to be the basis for migrainous photophobia. Additionally, light induced the phosphorylation of extracellular-related kinase (pERK) in neurons of the central amygdala, an intracellular signal associated with the processing of the aversive aspects of pain. However, light did not activate Fos expression in the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis, the primary receptive field for painful stimulation to the head. We conclude that these light-evoked vocalizations and the distinct pattern of brain activation in neonatal mice are consistent with a melanopsin-dependent neural pathway involved in processing light as an aversive but not acutely painful stimulus.\n",

Probenecid is a non-selective inhibitor of multidrug-resistance associated proteins and organic anion transporters thus it can modulate the transport functions in the central nervous system influencing nociception. Accordingly, the aim of the present experiments was to examine the effects of probenecid administration on the nitroglycerin-induced expressions of nNOS, CamKIIalpha and CGRP in the rat caudal trigeminal nucleus. Probenecid (200 mg/kg bodyweight, i.p.) pretreatment proved to mitigate the nitroglycerin-induced changes in expression in the rat caudal trigeminal nucleus. The data suggest that the changes caused by nitroglycerin in the expressions of CGRP, nNOS and CamKIIalpha can be influenced by probenecid modulating the inflammatory functions in the nervous system. These data may be of relevance for the pathogenesis of migraine headache.\n",

      "PMID:  27746346\n",
      "Abs: Orofacial pain conditions including temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and migraine are characterized by peripheral and central sensitization of trigeminal nociceptive neurons. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in promoting bidirectional signaling within the trigeminal system to mediate sensitization of primary nociceptive neurons. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intercisternally with CGRP or co-injected with the receptor antagonist CGRP(8-37) or KT 5720, a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor. Nocifensive head withdrawal response to mechanical stimulation was investigated using von Frey filaments. Expression of PKA, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) in the spinal cord and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (P-ERK) in the ganglion was studied using immunohistochemistry. Some animals were co-injected with CGRP and Fast Blue dye and the ganglion was imaged using fluorescent microscopy. CGRP increased nocifensive responses to mechanical stimulation when compared to control. Co-injection of CGRP(8-37) or KT 5720 with CGRP inhibited the nocifensive response. CGRP stimulated PKA and GFAP expression in the spinal cord, and P-ERK in ganglion neurons. Seven days post injection, Fast Blue was observed in ganglion neurons and satellite glial cells. Our results demonstrate that elevated levels of CGRP in the upper spinal cord promote sensitization of primary nociceptive neurons via a mechanism that involves activation of PKA centrally and P-ERK in ganglion neurons. Our findings provide evidence of bidirectional signaling within the trigeminal system that facilitate increased neuron-glia communication within the ganglion associated with trigeminal sensitization.CI - Copyright © 2016 IBRO.

      "PMID:  29208525\n",
      "Abs: The Wnt signalling pathway is a critical regulator of bone mass and quality. Several heterozygous mutations in the LRP5 gene, a Wnt co-receptor, causing high bone mass (LRP5-HBM) have been described to date. The pathogenic mechanism is thought to be a gain-of-function caused by impaired inhibition of the canonical Wnt signalling pathway, thereby leading to increased bone formation. We report the cases of two affected family members, a 53-year-old mother and her 23-year-old daughter, with high bone mass (T-scores mother: lumbar spine 11.4, femoral neck 10.5; T-scores daughter: lumbar spine 5.4, femoral neck 8.7), increased calvarial thickness, and thickened cortices of the long bones but no history of fractures. Whereas the mother did not show any indications of the mutation, the daughter suffered from congenital hearing impairment resulting in cochlear implantation, recurrent facial palsy, and migraine. In addition, she had stenosis of the foramen magnum. In both individuals, we detected a novel heterozygous duplication of six basepairs in the LRP5 gene, resulting in an insertion of two amino acids, very likely associated with a gain-of-function. When the daughter had part of the occipital bone surgically removed, the bone sample was used for the visualization of bone lamellar structure and bone cells as well as the measurement of bone mineralization density distribution (BMDD). The bone sample revealed two distinctly different regions: an intra-cortical region with osteonal remodeling, typical osteonal lamellar orientation, associated with relatively higher heterogeneity of bone matrix mineralization, and another periosteal region devoid of bone remodeling, with parallel bone lamellae and lower heterogeneity of mineralization. In conclusion, we present data on bone tissue and material level from an LRP5-HBM patient with a novel mutation in the LRP5 gene. Our findings indicate normal morphology of osteoclasts and osteoblasts as well as normal mineralization in skull bone in LRP5-HBM.CI - Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Abs: Using a combination of RT - PCR and inverse-PCR techniques, we amplified, cloned and sequenced a full-length porcine 5-HT(1B) receptor cDNA derived from porcine cerebral cortex. Sequence analysis revealed 1170 bp encoding an open reading frame of 390 amino acids showing a 95% similarity with the human 5-HT(1B) receptor. The recombinant porcine 5-HT(1B) cDNA was expressed in monkey Cos-7 cells and its pharmacological profile was determined by radioligand binding assay using [(3)H]-GR125743. The affinities of several agonists (L694247>ergotamine > or =5-carboxamidotryptamine=dihydroergotamine=5-HT>CP122638=zolmitriptan>sumatriptan) and putative antagonists (GR127935>methiothepin>SB224289>>ritanserin>ketanserin > or =BRL15572) correlated highly with those described for the recombinant human 5-HT(1B) receptor. In membranes obtained from cells co-expressing the porcine 5-HT(1B) receptor and a mutant G(alphao)Cys(351)Ile protein, 5-HT and zolmitriptan increased, while the 5-HT(1B) receptor antagonist SB224289 decreased basal [(35)S]-GTPgammaS binding, thus showing inverse agonism. The potency of zolmitriptan in the [(35)S]-GTPgammaS binding assay (pEC(50): 7.64+/-0.04) agreed with its affinity in displacing the antagonist [(3)H]-GR125743 (pK(i): 7.36+/-0.07). The 5-HT(1B) receptor mRNA was observed by RT-PCR in several blood vessels, cerebral cortex, cerebellum and trigeminal ganglion. In situ hybridization performed in frontal cerebral cortex sections revealed the expression of 5-HT(1B) receptor mRNA in pyramidal cells. In conclusion, we have cloned and established the amino acid sequence, ligand binding profile and location of the porcine 5-HT(1B) receptor. This information may be useful in exploring the role of 5-HT(1B) receptor in pathophysiological processes relevant for novel drug discovery in diseases such as migraine.\n",

      "PMID:  27899434\n",
      "Abs: Background and objective Posttraumatic headache (PTH) is one of the most common, debilitating and difficult symptoms to manage after a mild traumatic brain injury, or concussion. However, the mechanisms underlying PTH remain elusive, in part due to the lack of a clinically relevant animal model. Here, we characterized for the first time, headache and pain-related behaviours in a rat model of concussion evoked by a mild closed head injury (mCHI) - the major type of military and civilian related trauma associated with PTH - and tested responses to current and novel headache therapies. Methods Concussion was induced in adult male rats using a weight-drop device. Characterization of headache and pain related behaviours included assessment of cutaneous tactile pain sensitivity, using von Frey monofilaments, and ongoing pain using the conditioned place preference or aversion (CPP/CPA) paradigms. Sensitivity to headache/migraine triggers was tested by exposing rats to low-dose glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). Treatments included acute systemic administration of sumatriptan and chronic systemic administration of a mouse anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody. Results Concussed rats developed cephalic tactile pain hypersensitivity that was resolved by two weeks post-injury and was ameliorated by treatment with sumatriptan or anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody. Sumatriptan also produced CPP seven days post mCHI, but not in sham animals. Following the resolution of the concussion-evoked cephalic hypersensitivity, administration of GTN produced a renewed and pronounced cephalic pain hypersensitivity that was inhibited by sumatriptan or anti-CGRP antibody treatment as well as a CGRP-dependent CPA. GTN had no effect in sham animals. Conclusions Concussion leads to the development of headache and pain-related behaviours, in particular sustained enhanced responses to GTN, that are mediated through a CGRP-dependent mechanism. Treatment with anti-CGRP antibodies may be a useful approach to treat PTH.\n",

      "PMID:  26510178\n",
      "Abs: Orofacial pain is a common clinical symptom that is accompanied by tooth pain, migraine and gingivitis. Accumulating evidence suggests that acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), especially ASIC3, can profoundly affect the physiological properties of nociception in peripheral sensory neurons. The aim of this study is to examine the contribution of ASICs in trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons to orofacial inflammatory pain. A Western blot (WB), immunofluorescence assay of labelled trigeminal ganglion neurons, orofacial formalin test, cell preparation and electrophysiological experiments are performed. This study demonstrated that ASIC1, ASIC2a and ASIC3 are highly expressed in TG neurons innervating the orofacial region of rats. The amplitude of ASIC currents in these neurons increased 119.72% (for ASIC1-like current) and 230.59% (for ASIC3-like current) in the formalin-induced orofacial inflammatory pain model. In addition, WB and immunofluorescence assay demonstrated a significantly augmented expression of ASICs in orofacial TG neurons during orofacial inflammation compared with the control group. The relative protein density of ASIC1, ASIC2a and ASIC3 also increased 58.82 ± 8.92%, 45.30 ± 11.42% and 55.32 ± 14.71%, respectively, compared with the control group. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of ASICs and genetic deletion of ASIC1 attenuated the inflammation response. These findings indicate that peripheral inflammation can induce the upregulation of ASICs in TG neurons, causing orofacial inflammatory pain. Additionally, the specific inhibitor of ASICs may have a significant analgesic effect on orofacial inflammatory pain.CI - © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.\n",

      "PMID:  12480795\n",
      "Abs: Among the fatty acids, it is the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) which possess the most potent immunomodulatory activities, and among the omega-3 PUFA, those from fish oil-eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)--are more biologically potent than alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). Some of the effects of omega-3 PUFA are brought about by modulation of the amount and types of eicosanoids made, and other effects are elicited by eicosanoid-independent mechanisms, including actions upon intracellular signaling pathways, transcription factor activity and gene expression. Animal experiments and clinical intervention studies indicate that omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and, therefore, might be useful in the management of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Coronary heart disease, major depression, aging and cancer are characterized by an increased level of interleukin 1 (IL-1), a proinflammatory cytokine. Similarly, arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and lupus erythematosis are autoimmune diseases characterized by a high level of IL-1 and the proinflammatory leukotriene LTB(4) produced by omega-6 fatty acids. There have been a number of clinical trials assessing the benefits of dietary supplementation with fish oils in several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases in humans, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis and migraine headaches. Many of the placebo-controlled trials of fish oil in chronic inflammatory diseases reveal significant benefit, including decreased disease activity and a lowered use of anti-inflammatory drugs.\n",

      "PMID:  31242047\n",
      "Abs: Cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) induces pro-inflammatory gene expression in brain tissue. However, previous studies assessing the relationship between CSD and inflammation have used invasive methods that directly trigger inflammation. To eliminate the injury confounder, we induced CSDs non-invasively through intact skull using optogenetics in Thy1-channelrhodopsin-2 transgenic mice. We corroborated our findings by minimally invasive KCl-induced CSDs through thinned skull. Six CSDs induced over 1 h dramatically increased cortical interleukin-1β (IL-1β), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mRNA expression peaking around 1, 2 and 4 h, respectively. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were only modestly elevated. A single CSD also increased IL-1β, CCL2, and TNF-α, and revealed an ultra-early IL-1β response within 10 min. The response was blunted in IL-1 receptor-1 knockout mice, implicating IL-1β as an upstream mediator, and suppressed by dexamethasone, but not ibuprofen. CSD did not alter systemic inflammatory indices. In summary, this is the first report of pro-inflammatory gene expression after non-invasively induced CSDs. Altogether, our data provide novel insights into the role of CSD-induced neuroinflammation in migraine headache pathogenesis and have implications for the inflammatory processes in acute brain injury where numerous CSDs occur for days.\n",

      "PMID:  27445142\n",
      "Abs: Patients with Type 6 episodic ataxia (EA6) have mutations of the excitatory amino acid transporter EAAT1 (also known as GLAST), but the underlying pathophysiological mechanism for EA6 is not known. EAAT1 is a glutamate transporter expressed by astrocytes and other glia, and it serves dual function as an anion channel. One EA6-associated mutation is a P>R substitution (EAAT1(P>R)) that in transfected cells has a reduced rate of glutamate transport and an abnormal anion conductance. We expressed this EAAT1(P>R) mutation in glial cells of Drosophila larvae and found that these larvae exhibit episodic paralysis, and their astrocytes poorly infiltrate the CNS neuropil. These defects are not seen in Eaat1-null mutants, and so they cannot be explained by loss of glutamate transport. We instead explored the role of the abnormal anion conductance of the EAAT1(P>R) mutation, and to do this we expressed chloride cotransporters in astrocytes. Like the EAAT1(P>R) mutation, the chloride-extruding K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter KccB also caused astroglial malformation and paralysis, supporting the idea that the EAAT1(P>R) mutation causes abnormal chloride flow from CNS glia. In contrast, the Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter Ncc69, which normally allows chloride into cells, rescued the effects of the EAAT1(P>R) mutation. Together, our results indicate that the cytopathology and episodic paralysis in our Drosophila EA6 model stem from a gain-of-function chloride channelopathy of glial cells. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We studied a mutation found in episodic ataxia of the dual-function glutamate transporter/anion channel EAAT1, and discovered it caused malformation of astrocytes and episodes of paralysis in a Drosophila model. These effects were mimicked by a chloride-extruding cotransporter and were rescued by restoring chloride homeostasis to glial cells with a Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter. Our findings reveal a new pathophysiological mechanism in which astrocyte cytopathology and neural circuit dysfunction arise via disruption of the ancillary function of EAAT1 as a chloride channel. In some cases, this mechanism might also be important for neurological diseases related to episodic ataxia, such as hemiplegia, migraine, and epilepsy.CI - Copyright © 2016 the authors 0270-6474/16/367640-08$15.00/0.\n",

      "PMID:  31756985\n",
      "Abs: The neuropeptide CGRP, acting through the G-protein coupled receptor CALCRL and its coreceptor RAMP1, plays a key role in migraines, which has led to the clinical development of several inhibitory compounds. Recently, high CALCRL expression has been shown to be associated with a poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We investigate, therefore, the functional role of the CGRP-CALCRL axis in AML. To this end, in silico analyses, human AML cell lines, primary patient samples, and a C57BL/6-based mouse model of AML are used. We find that CALCRL is up-regulated at relapse of AML, in leukemic stem cells (LSCs) versus bulk leukemic cells, and in LSCs versus normal hematopoietic stem cells. CGRP protects receptor-positive AML cell lines and primary AML samples from apoptosis induced by cytostatic drugs used in AML therapy, and this effect is inhibited by specific antagonists. Furthermore, the CGRP antagonist olcegepant increases differentiation and reduces the leukemic burden as well as key stem cell properties in a mouse model of AML. These data provide a basis for further investigations into a possible role of CGRP-CALCRL inhibition in the therapy of AML.\n",

      "PMID:  26076849\n",
      "Abs: PURPOSE: To determine clinical phenotypes, evolution and genetic background of a large family with a combination of two unusual forms of reflex epilepsies. METHOD: Phenotyping was performed in eighteen family members (10 F, 8 M) including standardized EEG recordings with intermittent photic stimulation (IPS). Genetic analyses (linkage scans, Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) and Functional studies) were performed using photoparoxysmal EEG responses (PPRs) as affection status. RESULTS: The proband suffered from speaking induced jaw-jerks and increasing limb jerks evoked by flickering sunlight since about 50 years of age. Three of her family members had the same phenotype. Generalized PPRs were found in seven members (six above 50 years of age) with myoclonus during the PPR. Evolution was typical: Sensitivity to lights with migraine-like complaints around adolescence, followed by jerks evoked by lights and spontaneously with dropping of objects, and strong increase of light sensitivity and onset of talking induced jaw jerks around 50 years. Linkage analysis showed suggestive evidence for linkage to four genomic regions. All photosensitive family members shared a heterozygous R129C mutation in the SCNM1 gene that regulates splicing of voltage gated ion channels. Mutation screening of 134 unrelated PPR patients and 95 healthy controls, did not replicate these findings. CONCLUSION: This family presents a combination of two rare reflex epilepsies. Genetic analysis favors four genomic regions and points to a shared SCNM1 mutation that was not replicated in a general cohort of photosensitive subjects. Further genetic studies in families with similar combination of features are warranted.CI - Copyright © 2015 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

She had severe hearing loss and suffered from frequent episodes of migraine. Although a brain MRI disclosed a T2-hyperintense lesion in the left parietal lobe, she had hardly any long-term sequela. Exercise intolerance, myalgias and limb-girdle muscle weakness indicated a slowly progressive myopathy. Extra-neurological features included short stature, and secondary amenorrhea with low gonadotropin levels, indicating secondary hypogonadism. However, she had three mutation-free, healthy children by ovarian stimulation. A muscle biopsy showed ragged-red, cytochrome c oxidase-negative fibers, and an isolated defect of cytochrome c oxidase activity in muscle mitochondria. Sequence analysis of muscle mtDNA revealed a previously unreported heteroplasmic m.6597C>A transversion in the MTCOI gene, encoding subunit I of cytochrome c oxidase, corresponding to p.Q232K aminoacid change.

      "PMID:  22647225\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND/AIM: The nuclear POLG gene encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase gamma (polγ), the only polymerase involved in the replication and proofreading of mitochondrial DNA. As a consequence, POLG mutations can cause disease through impaired replication of mitochondrial DNA. To date, over 150 different mutations have been identified, with a growing number of associated phenotypes described. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of POLG mutations in an adult population of Australian patients with mitochondrial disease, displaying symptoms commonly associated with POLG-related diseases. METHODS: The clinical presentations of 322 patients from a specialist adult mitochondrial disease clinic were reviewed. Nineteen exhibited a cluster of three or more predefined clinical manifestations suggestive of POLG-related disease: progressive external ophthalmoplegia, seizures and/or an abnormal electroencephalogram, neuropathy, ataxia, liver function abnormalities, migraine or dysphagia/dysarthria. Patients were screened for mutations by direct nucleotide sequencing of the coding and exon-flanking intronic regions of POLG. RESULTS: Five of the 19 patients (26%) displaying a phenotype suggestive of POLG-related disease were found to have informative POLG coding mutations (p.T851A, p.N468D, p.Y831C, p.G517V and novel p.P163S variant). Literature and analysis of these mutations revealed that two of these patients had pathogenic mutations known to cause POLG-related disease (patient #1: p.T851A and p.P163S; patient #2: p.T851A and p.N468D). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the prevalence of pathogenic POLG mutations in our selected adult Australian cohort with suggestive clinical manifestations was 10%. A further 16% of patients had POLG variants but are unlikely to be responsible for causing their disease.CI - © 2012 The Authors; Internal Medicine Journal © 2012 Royal Australasian College of Physicians.\n",

      "Abs: Mitochondrial diseases, predominantly mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), may occasionally underlie or coincide with ischemic stroke (IS) in young and middle-aged individuals. We searched for undiagnosed patients with MELAS in a target subpopulation of unselected young IS patients enrolled in the Stroke in Young Fabry Patients study (sifap1). Among the 3291 IS patients aged 18-55 years recruited to the sifap1 study at 47 centers across 14 European countries, we identified potential MELAS patients with the following phenotypic features: (a) diagnosed cardiomyopathy or (b) presence of two of the three following findings: migraine, short stature (≤165 cm for males; ≤155 cm for females), and diabetes. Identified patients' blood samples underwent analysis of the common MELAS mutation, m.3243A>G in the MTTL1 gene of mitochondrial DNA. Clinical and cerebral MRI features of the mutation carriers were reviewed. We analyzed blood samples of 238 patients (177 with cardiomyopathy) leading to identification of four previously unrecognized MELAS main mutation carrier-patients. Their clinical and MRI characteristics were within the expectation for common IS patients except for severe hearing loss in one patient and hyperintensity of the pulvinar thalami on T1-weighted MRI in another one. Genetic testing for the m.3243A>G MELAS mutation in young patients with IS based on phenotypes suggestive of mitochondrial disease identifies previously unrecognized carriers of MELAS main mutation, but does not prove MELAS as the putative cause.\n",

The present study explores whether the PRRT2 mutation is a potential cause of febrile seizures, including febrile seizures plus (FS+), generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) and Dravet syndrome (DS); thus, it may provide a new drug target for personalized medicine for febrile seizure patients. We screened PRRT2 exons in a cohort of 136 epileptic patients with febrile seizures, including FS+, GEFS+ and DS. PRRT2 genetic mutations were identified in 25 out of 136 (18.4%) febrile seizures in epileptic patients. Five loss-of-function and coding missense mutations were identified: c.649delC (p.R217Efs*12), c.649_650insC (p.R217Pfs*8), c.412C>G (p.Pro138Ala), c.439G>C (p.Asp147His) and c.623C>A (p.Ser208Tyr).

      "Abs: Brain tumors, particularly high-grade glioblastomas, are a crucial public health issue due to poor prognosis and an extremely low survival rate. The glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) grows rapidly within its unique microenvironment that is characterized by active neural communications. Therefore, diverse neurotransmitters not only maintain normal brain functions but also influence glioma progression. To fully appreciate the relationship between neurotransmitters and glioma progression, we reviewed potential neurotransmitter contributors in human GBM and the much less aggressive Low-grade glioma (LGG) by combining previously published data from gene-mutation/mRNA sequencing databases together with protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis results. The summarized results indicate that glutamatergic and calcium signaling may provide positive feedback to promote glioma formation through 1) metabolic reprogramming and genetic switching to accelerate glioma duplication and progression; 2) upregulation of cytoskeleton proteins and elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) levels to increase glutamate release and facilitate formation of synaptic-like connections with surrounding cells in their microenvironment. The upregulated glutamatergic neuronal activities in turn stimulate glioma growth and signaling. Importantly, the enhanced electrical and molecular signals from both neurons and glia propagate out to enable glioma symptoms such as epilepsy and migraine. The elevated intracellular Ca(2+) also activates nitric oxide synthase to produce nitric oxide (NO) that can either promote or inhibit tumorigenesis. By analyzing the network effects for complex interaction among neurotransmitters such as glutamate, Ca(2+) and NO in brain tumor progression, especially GBM, we identified the glutamatergic signaling as the potential therapeutic targets and suggest manipulation of glutamatergic signaling may be an effective treatment strategy for this aggressive brain cancer.CI - Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

      "PMID:  24144624\n",
      "Abs: In the trigeminal ganglion (TG), satellite glial cells (SGCs) form a functional unit with neurons. It has been proposed that SGCs participate in regulating extracellular glutamate levels and that dysfunction of this SGC capacity can impact nociceptive transmission in craniofacial pain conditions. This study investigated whether SGCs release glutamate and whether elevation of TG glutamate concentration alters response properties of trigeminal afferent fibers. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess glutamate content and the expression of excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT)1 and EAAT2 in TG sections. SGCs contained glutamate and expressed EAAT1 and EAAT2. Potassium chloride (10 mM) was used to evoke glutamate release from cultured rat SGCs treated with the EAAT1/2 inhibitor (3S)-3-[[3-[[4-(trifluoromethyl)ben zoyl]amino]phenyl]methoxy]-L-aspartic acid (TFB-TBOA) or control. Treatment with TFB-TBOA (1 and 10 μM) significantly reduced the glutamate concentration from 10.6 ± 1.1 to 5.8 ± 1.4 μM and 3.0 ± 0.8 μM, respectively (p<0.05). Electrophysiology experiments were conducted in anaesthetized rats to determine the effect of intraganglionic injections of glutamate on the response properties of ganglion neurons that innervated either the temporalis or masseter muscle. Intraganglionic injection of glutamate (500 mM, 3 μl) evoked afferent discharge and significantly reduced muscle afferent mechanical threshold. Glutamate-evoked discharge was attenuated bythe N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV) and increased by TFB-TBOA, whereas mechanical sensitization was only sensitive to APV. Antidromic invasion of muscle afferent fibers by electrical stimulation of the caudal brainstem (10 Hz) or local anesthesia of the brainstem with lidocaine did not alter glutamate-induced mechanical sensitization. These findings provide a novel mechanism whereby dysfunctional trigeminal SGCs could contribute to cranial muscle tenderness in craniofacial pain conditions such as migraine headache.CI - Copyright © 2013 IBRO.

      "PMID:  19383090\n",
      "Abs: As the leading genetic cause for infantile death, Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) has been extensively studied since its first description in the early 1890s. Though today much is known about the cause of the disease, a cure or effective treatment is not currently available. Recently the short chain fatty acid valproic acid, a drug used for decades in the management of epilepsy and migraine therapy, has been shown to elevate the levels of the essential survival motor neuron protein in cultured cells. In SMA mice, valproic acid diminished the severity of the disease phenotype. This effect was linked to the ability of the short chain fatty acid to suppress histone deacetylase activity and activate gene transcription. Since then, the study of different histone deacetylase inhibitors and their epigenetic modifying capabilities has been of high interest in an attempt to find potential candidates for effective treatment of SMA. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about use of histone deacetylase inhibitors in SMA as well as their proposed effects on chromatin structure and discuss further implications for possible treatments of SMA arising from research examining epigenetic change.\n",

      "PMID:  18044013\n",
      "Abs: The Na,K-ATPase is composed of multiple isoforms and the isoform distribution varies with the tissue and during development. The alpha1 isoform for example, is the major isoform in the kidney and many other tissues, while the alpha2 isoform is the predominate one in skeletal muscle. All three isoforms are found in the brain although in adult rodent brain, the alpha 3 isoform is located essentially in neurons while the alpha2 isoform is found in astrocytes and some limited neuronal populations. Interestingly the alpha 4 isoform is found exclusively in the mid region of the sperm tail. The distribution of the isoforms of the Na,K-ATPase has been extensively studied in many tissues and during development. The examples cited above provide some indication to the diversity of Na,K-ATPase isoform expression. In order to understand the significance of this distribution, we have developed animals which lack the alpha1, alpha2, and alpha 3 isoforms. It is anticipated that these studies will provide insight into the role that these isoforms play in driving various biological processes in specific tissues. Here we describe some of our studies which deal with the behavioral aspects of the alpha1, alpha2, and alpha 3 deficient mice, particularly those that are haploinsufficient in one isoform i.e. lacking one functional gene for the alpha1, alpha2, or alpha 3 isoforms. Such studies are important as two human diseases are associated with deficiency in the alpha2 and alpha 3 isoforms. These are Familial Hemiplegic Migraine type 2 and Rapid-Onset Dystonia Parkinsonism, these diseases result from alpha2 and alpha 3 isoform haploinsufficiency, respectively. We find that the haploinsufficiency of both alpha2 and alpha 3 isoforms result in behavioral defects.\n",

      "PMID:  31894268\n",
      "Abs: Insulin‑like growth factor‑1 (IGF‑1) regulates cell growth, glucose uptake and protein metabolism, and is required for growth hormone (GH) signaling‑mediated insulin production and secretion. IGF1 expression is associated with STAT5, which binds to a region (TTCNNNGAA) of the gene. Although sulfur is used in various fields, the toxicity of this element is a significant disadvantage as it causes indigestion, vomiting, diarrhea, pain and migraine. Therefore, it is difficult to conduct in vitro experiments to directly determine the effects of dietary sulfur. Additionally, it is difficult to dissolve non‑toxic sulfur (NTS). The present study aimed to identify the role of NTS in GH signaling as a Jak2/STAT5b/IGF‑1 pathway regulator. MTT assay was used to identify an optimum NTS concentration for C2C12 mouse muscle cells. Western blotting, RT‑PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation, overexpression and small interfering RNA analyses were performed. NTS was dissolved in 1 mg/ml DMSO and could be used in vitro. Therefore, the present study determined whether NTS induced mouse muscle cell growth via GH signaling. NTS notably increased STAT5b binding to the Igf1 promoter. NTS also promoted GH signaling by upregulating GH receptor expression, similar to GH treatment. NTS enhanced GH signaling by regulating Jak2/STAT5b/IGF‑1 signaling pathway factor expression in C2C12 mouse muscle cells. Thus, NTS may be used as a GH‑enhancing growth stimulator.\n",

      "PMID:  30240937\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: This study tested whether galcanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody with efficacy against migraine, was superior to placebo for the treatment of mild or moderate osteoarthritis (OA) knee pain. METHOD: In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo- and celecoxib-controlled trial, patients with moderate to severe OA pain were randomized to placebo; celecoxib 200 mg daily for 16 weeks; or galcanezumab 5, 50, 120, and 300 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks, twice. The primary outcome was change from baseline at Week 8 in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscore measured by 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS). The trial was considered positive if ≥1 dose of galcanezumab demonstrated ≥95% Bayesian posterior probability of superiority to placebo and ≥50% posterior probability of superiority to placebo by ≥9 mm. A planned interim analysis allowed termination of the study if posterior probability of superiority to placebo by ≥9 mm was ≤5%. Secondary endpoints included WOMAC function subscore and Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of OA. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. RESULTS: The study was terminated after interim analysis suggested inadequate efficacy. Celecoxib significantly reduced WOMAC pain subscore compared with placebo [-12.0 mm; 95% confidence interval (CI) -23 to -2 mm]. None of the galcanezumab arms demonstrated clinically meaningful improvement (range: 1.5 to -5.0 mm) or met the prespecified success criteria. No improvement in any secondary objective was observed. Galcanezumab was well tolerated by OA patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study failed to demonstrate sufficient statistical evidence that galcanezumab was efficacious for treating OA knee pain.

      "PMID:  11834243\n",
      "Abs: Using a combination of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and inverse-PCR techniques, we amplified, cloned and sequenced a full-length porcine 5-hydroxytryptamine 1F (5-ht(1F)) receptor complementary DNA (cDNA) derived from porcine trigeminal ganglion. Sequence analysis revealed 1101 base pairs (bp) encoding an open reading frame of 366 amino acids showing a high similarity (>90%) with the 5-ht(1F) receptor sequences from other species, including human. The recombinant porcine 5-ht(1F) receptor was expressed in African green monkey kidney cell lines (COS-7 cells) and its ligand binding profile was determined using [3H]5-HT. The affinities of several agonists (LY334370 (5-(4-fluorobenzoyl)amino-3-(1-methylpiperidin-4-yl)-1H-indole fumarate)>CP122638 (N-methyl-3 [pyrrolidin 2(R)-yl methyl]-1H-indol-5-ylmethyl sulphonamide)=naratriptan =5HT>eletriptan>sumatriptan>frovatriptan =avitriptan>dihydroergotamine>zolmitriptan>5-carboxamidotryptamine>rizatriptan>alniditan=donitriptan>L694247 (2-[5-[3-(4-methylsulphonylamino)benzyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl]-1H-indole-3-yl] ethylamine) and putative antagonists (methiothepin>GR127935 (N-[4-methoxy-3-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl) phenyl]-2'-methyl 4'-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl) [1,1-biphenyl]-4-carboxamide hydrochloride)>ritanserin>SB224289 (2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1'-methyl-5-[2'-methyl-4'(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl) biphenyl-4-carbonyl] furo [2,3-f] indole-3-spiro-4'-piperidine hydrochloride)>BRL155572 ([1-(3-chlorophenyl)-4-[3,3-diphenyl (2-(S,R) hydroxypropanyl)piperazine] hydrochloride)>ketanserin=pindolol) correlated highly with those described for the recombinant human 5-ht(1F) receptor (Spearman correlation coefficient; r(s)=0.942). Nevertheless, as compared to the human homologue, some triptans (i.e. sumatriptan, zolmitriptan and rizatriptan) displayed a 10- to 15-fold lower affinity for the porcine 5-ht(1F) receptor. Using RT-PCR technique, the expression of porcine 5-ht(1F) receptor mRNA was observed in cerebral cortex, trigeminal ganglion and several blood vessels, but not in skeletal muscles. In conclusion, we have cloned and established the amino acid sequence and ligand binding profile of the porcine 5-ht(1F) receptor as well as the distribution of its mRNA. This information may be helpful in exploring the role of 5-ht(1F) receptor in physiological processes and diseases, such as migraine.\n",

      "PMID:  25998140\n",
      "Abs: BACKGROUND: Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) may coexist with Brugada syndrome (BrS). OBJECTIVES: The present study was designed to determine the prevalence of drug-induced type 1 Brugada ECG pattern (concealed BrS) in patients presenting with clinical spontaneous AVNRT and to investigate their electrocardiographic, electrophysiological, and genetic characteristics. METHODS: Ninety-six consecutive patients without any sign of BrS on baseline electrocardiogram undergoing electrophysiological study and ablation for symptomatic, drug-resistant AVNRT and 66 control subjects underwent an ajmaline challenge to unmask BrS. Genetic screening was performed in 17 patients displaying both AVNRT and BrS. RESULTS: A concealed BrS electrocardiogram was uncovered in 26 of 96 patients with AVNRT (27.1%) and in 3 of 66 control subjects (4.5%) (P ≤ .001). Patients with concealed BrS were predominantly female patients (n=23 [88.5%] vs n=44 [62.9%], P = .015), had higher prevalence of chest pain (n=10 [38.5%] vs n=13 [18.6%], p=0.042), migraine headaches (n=10 [38.5%] vs n=10 [14.2%], p=0.008), and drug-induced initiation and/or worsening of duration and/or frequency of AVNRT (n=4 [15.4%] vs n=1 [1.4%], p=0.006) as compared to patients with AVNRT without BrS. Genetic screening identified 19 mutations or rare variants in 13 genes in 13 of 17 patients with both AVNRT and BrS (yield = 76.5%). Ten of these 13 genotype-positive patients (76.9%) harbored genetic variants known or suspected to cause a loss of function of cardiac sodium channel current (SCN5A, SCN10A, SCN1B, GPD1L, PKP2, and HEY2). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that spontaneous AVNRT and concealed BrS co-occur, particularly in female patients, and that genetic variants that reduce sodium channel current may provide a mechanistic link between AVNRT and BrS and predispose to expression of both phenotypes.CI - Copyright © 2015 Heart Rhythm Society.

      "PMID:  28460791\n",
      "Abs: The superior sagittal sinus (SSS) of the mammalian brain is a pain-sensitive intracranial vessel thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of migraine headaches. Here, we aimed to investigate the presence and the potential co-localization of some neurotransmitters in the human SSS. Immunohistochemical and double-labeling immunofluorescence analyses were applied to paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded, coronal sections of the SSS. Protein extraction and Western blotting technique were performed on the same material to confirm the morphological data. Our results showed nerve fibers clustered mainly in large bundles tracking parallel to the longitudinal axis of the sinus, close in proximity to the vascular endothelium. Smaller fascicles of fibers encircled the vascular lumen in a spiral fashion, extending through the subendothelial connective tissue. Isolated nerve fibers were observed around the openings of bridging veins in the sinus or around small vessels extending into the perisinusal dura. The neurotransmitters calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and neuropeptide Y (NPY) were found in parietal nerve structures, distributed all along the length of the SSS. Overall, CGRP- and TH-containing nerve fibers were the most abundant. Neurotransmitters co-localized in the same fibers in the following pairs: CGRP/SP, CGRP/NOS, CGRP/VIP, and TH/NPY. Western blotting analysis confirmed the presence of such neurosubstances in the SSS wall. Overall our data provide the first evidence of the presence and co-localization of critical neurotransmitters in the SSS of the human brain, thus contributing to a better understanding of the sinus functional role.CI - Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

      "PMID:  27940914\n",
      "Abs: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a substantial burden to patients, families, and society, but many patients cannot be treated adequately. Rodent experiments suggest that the neuropeptide galanin (GAL) and its three G protein-coupled receptors, GAL(1-3), are involved in mood regulation. To explore the translational potential of these results, we assessed the transcript levels (by quantitative PCR), DNA methylation status (by bisulfite pyrosequencing), and GAL peptide by RIA of the GAL system in postmortem brains from depressed persons who had committed suicide and controls. Transcripts for all four members were detected and showed marked regional variations, GAL and galanin receptor 1 (GALR1) being most abundant. Striking increases in GAL and GALR3 mRNA levels, especially in the noradrenergic locus coeruleus and the dorsal raphe nucleus, in parallel with decreased DNA methylation, were found in both male and female suicide subjects as compared with controls. In contrast, GAL and GALR3 transcript levels were decreased, GALR1 was increased, and DNA methylation was increased in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of male suicide subjects, however, there were no changes in the anterior cingulate cortex. Thus, GAL and its receptor GALR3 are differentially methylated and expressed in brains of MDD subjects in a region- and sex-specific manner. Such an epigenetic modification in GALR3, a hyperpolarizing receptor, might contribute to the dysregulation of noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons implicated in the pathogenesis of MDD. Thus, one may speculate that a GAL(3) antagonist could have antidepressant properties by disinhibiting the firing of these neurons, resulting in increased release of noradrenaline and serotonin in forebrain areas involved in mood regulation.\n",

      "PMID:  19751368\n",
      "Abs: OBJECTIVE: To investigate nitric oxide (NO)-mediated changes in expression of cyclic nucleotide degrading phosphodiesterases 2A (PDE2A), PDE3B, and PDE5A in human endothelial cells. BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide induces production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which along with cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is degraded by PDEs. NO donors and selective inhibitors of PDE3 and PDE5 induce migraine-like headache and play a role in endothelial dysfunction during stroke. The current study investigates possible NO modulation of cGMP-related PDEs relevant to headache induction in a cell line containing such PDEs. METHODS: Real time polymerase chain reaction and Western blots were used to show expression of PDE2A, PDE3B, and PDE5A in a stable cell line of human brain microvascular endothelial cells. Effects of NO on PDE expression were analyzed at specific time intervals after continued DETA NONOate administration. RESULTS: This study shows the expression of PDE2A, PDE3B, and PDE5A mRNA and PDE3B and PDE5A protein in human cerebral endothelial cells. Long-term DETA NONOate administration induced an immediate mRNA up-regulation of PDE5A (1.9-fold, 0.5 hour), an early peak of PDE2A (1.4-fold, 1 and 2 hours) and later up-regulation of both PDE3B (1.6-fold, 4 hours) and PDE2A (1.7-fold, 8 hours and 1.2-fold after 24 hours). Such changes were, however, not translated into significant changes in protein expression indicating few, if any, functional effects. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term NO stimulation modulated PDE3 and PDE5 mRNA expression in endothelial cells. However, PDE3 and PDE5 protein levels were unaffected by NO. The presence of PDE3 or PDE5 in endothelial cells indicates that selective inhibitors may have functional effects in such cells. A complex interaction of cGMP and cAMP in response to NO administration may take place if the mRNA translates into active protein. Whether or not this plays a role in the headache mechanisms remains to be investigated.\n",

      "PMID:  16630053\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and nitric oxide are involved in the underlying pathophysiology of migraine and other diseases involving neurogenic inflammation. We have tested the hypothesis that nitric oxide might trigger signaling mechanisms within the trigeminal ganglia neurons that would coordinately stimulate CGRP synthesis and release. Treatment of primary trigeminal ganglia cultures with nitric oxide donors caused a greater than four-fold increase in CGRP release compared with unstimulated cultures. Similarly, CGRP promoter activity was also stimulated by nitric oxide donors and overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Cotreatment with the antimigraine drug sumatriptan greatly repressed nitric oxide stimulation of CGRP promoter activity and secretion. Somewhat surprisingly, the mechanisms of nitric oxide stimulation of CGRP secretion did not require cGMP or PI3-kinase signaling pathways, but rather, nitric oxide action required extracellular calcium and likely involves T-type calcium channels. Furthermore, nitric oxide was shown to increase expression of the active forms of the mitogen-activated protein kinases Jun amino-terminal kinase and p38 but not extracellular signal-related kinase in trigeminal neurons. In summary, our results provide new insight into the cellular mechanisms by which nitric oxide induces CGRP synthesis and secretion from trigeminal neurons.\n",

      "Abs: Purpose: To describe and distinguish clinical phenotypes with the overlapping feature of optic atrophy caused by distinct mutations in the same gene, OPA3. We report 3 affected siblings in a consanguineous family harboring a novel OPA3 mutation causing 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type III with optic atrophy.Methods: Retrospective case series.Results: Three siblings (2 male, 1 female) among 6 children in a consanguineous Afghani family developed decreased vision from early childhood. Both parents and all extended family members were unaffected. All 3 affected siblings suffered from severe visual impairment ranging from visual acuities of 20/150 to counting fingers. All had spastic lower extremity weakness and ataxia. Two of the three affected siblings also had a history of seizures, and the female sibling had limited cognition with diffuse atrophic changes on brain MRI. Two of the three individuals also had migraine-like headaches. Urine organic acid analysis revealed mildly elevated 3-methylglutaconic acid for the male siblings. Whole exome sequencing and subsequent PCR confirmation revealed a novel variant in OPA3 (intron1, c.142 + 2_142 + 3dupTG), affecting the consensus sequence of the splice site, for which all 3 clinically affected siblings were homozygous.Discussion: Mutations in OPA3 can cause optic atrophy in a dominant pattern of inheritance associated with cataract or in a recessive pattern associated with spastic paresis and ataxia. The novel recessive mutation and clinical presentations described herein further support how different mutation types affecting OPA3 can produce distinct clinical phenotypes and underscore the critical and susceptible role of mitochondrial health in optic nerve function.\n",

      "PMID:  28341244\n",
      "Abs: ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Angelica dahurica is a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine to treat migraine headache, toothache and cancer. Imperatorin is an active natural furocoumarin component originating from Angelica dahurica and has been shown to exhibit multiple bioeffector functions, including anti-cancer activity. However, the mechanism by which imperatorin inhibits tumor growth is not fully understood. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of imperatorin as a treatment of cancer and to identify the underlying mechanisms of its anticancer activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HCT116, HeLa, and Hep3B cells were used in this study. Major assays were promoter-reporter gene assay, MTT, western blot analysis, immunofluorescence assay, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), flow cytometric analysis, clonogenic assay, EdU labeling and immunofluorescence, xenografted assay, and VEGF ELISA. RESULTS: We here demonstrated the effect of imperatorin on hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) activation. Imperatorin showed a potent inhibitory activity against HIF-1 activation induced by hypoxia in various human cancer cell lines. This compound markedly decreased the hypoxia-induced accumulation of HIF-1α protein dose-dependently, whereas it did not affect the expressions of HIF-1β and topoisomerase-I (Topo-I). Further analysis revealed that imperatorin inhibited HIF-1α protein synthesis, without affecting the expression level of HIF-1α mRNA or degradation of HIF-1α protein. Moreover, the phosphorylation levels of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K), eIF4E binding protein-1 (4E-BP1), eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2), SAPK/JNK and p38 were significantly suppressed by imperatorin. Furthermore, imperatorin prevented hypoxia-induced expression of HIF-1 target genes and flow cytometric analysis indicated that imperatorin induced G1 phase arrest in human colon cancer cell (HCT116). We found that imperatorin administration inhibits tumor growth and blocks tumor angiogenesis in a xenograft tumor model. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that imperatorin inhibited HIF-1α protein synthesis by downregulating the mTOR/p70S6K/4E-BP1 and MAPK pathways. These conclusions suggest that imperatorin is an effective inhibitor of HIF-1 and provide new perspectives into the mechanism of its anticancer activity.CI - Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

      "PMID:  31805844\n",
      "Abs: Background and Purpose- Retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukoencephalopathy and systemic manifestations (RVCL-S) is an autosomal dominant small vessel disease caused by C-terminal frameshift mutations in the TREX1 gene that encodes the major mammalian 3' to 5' DNA exonuclease. RVCL-S is characterized by vasculopathy, especially in densely vascularized organs, progressive retinopathy, cerebral microvascular disease, white matter lesions, and migraine, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Methods- Homozygous transgenic RVCL-S knock-in mice expressing a truncated Trex1 (three prime repair exonuclease 1) protein (similar to what is seen in patients) and wild-type littermates, of various age groups, were subjected to (1) a survival analysis, (2) in vivo postocclusive reactive hyperemia and ex vivo Mulvany myograph studies to characterize the microvascular and macrovascular reactivity, and (3) experimental stroke after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion with neurological deficit assessment. Results- The mutant mice show increased mortality starting at midlife (P=0.03 with hazard ratio, 3.14 [95% CI, 1.05-9.39]). The mutants also show a vascular phenotype as evidenced by attenuated postocclusive reactive hyperemia responses (across all age groups; F[1, 65]=5.7, P=0.02) and lower acetylcholine-induced relaxations in aortae (in 20- to 24-month-old mice; RVCL-S knock-in: E(max): 37±8% versus WT: E(max): 65±6%, P=0.01). A vascular phenotype is also suggested by the increased infarct volume seen in 12- to 14-month-old mutant mice at 24 hours after infarct onset (RVCL-S knock-in: 75.4±2.7 mm(3) versus WT: 52.9±5.6 mm(3), P=0.01). Conclusions- Homozygous RVCL-S knock-in mice show increased mortality, signs of abnormal vascular function, and increased sensitivity to experimental stroke and can be instrumental to investigate the pathology seen in patients with RVCL-S.\n",

      "Title: Select steroid hormone glucuronide metabolites can cause toll-like receptor 4 activation and enhanced pain\n",
      "PMID:  25218902\n",
      "Abs: We have recently shown that several classes of glucuronide metabolites, including the morphine metabolite morphine-3-glucuronide and the ethanol metabolite ethyl glucuronide, cause toll like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent signaling in vitro and enhanced pain in vivo. Steroid hormones, including estrogens and corticosterone, are also metabolized through glucuronidation. Here we demonstrate that in silico docking predicts that corticosterone, corticosterone-21-glucuronide, estradiol, estradiol-3-glucuronide and estradiol-17-glucuronide all dock with the MD-2 component of the TLR4 receptor complex. In addition to each docking with MD-2, the docking of each was altered by pre-docking with (+)-naloxone, a TLR4 signaling inhibitor. As agonist versus antagonist activity cannot be determined from these in silico interactions, an in vitro study was undertaken to clarify which of these compounds can act in an agonist fashion. Studies using a cell line transfected with TLR4, necessary co-signaling molecules, and a reporter gene revealed that only estradiol-3-glucuronide and estradiol-17-glucuronide increased reporter gene product, indicative of TLR4 agonism. Finally, in in vivo studies, each of the 5 drugs was injected intrathecally at equimolar doses. In keeping with the in vitro results, only estradiol-3-glucuronide and estradiol-17-glucuronide caused enhanced pain. For both compounds, pain enhancement was blocked by the TLR4 antagonist lipopolysaccharide from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, evidence for the involvement in TLR4 in the resultant pain enhancement. These findings have implications for several chronic pain conditions, including migraine and temporomandibular joint disorder, in which pain episodes are more likely in cycling females when estradiol is decreasing and estradiol metabolites are at their highest.CI - Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

      "Title: Dual coupling of cloned human 5-hydroxytryptamine1D alpha and 5-hydroxytryptamine1D beta receptors stably expressed in murine fibroblasts: inhibition of adenylate cyclase and elevation of intracellular calcium concentrations via pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein(s)\n",
      "PMID:  8396718\n",
      "Abs: The second messenger coupling of cloned human 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1D alpha and 5-HT1D beta receptors stably expressed in murine fibroblasts (LM (tk-)) was investigated. Clonal cell lines expressing similar receptor densities (Bmax = 750-950 fmol/mg) were used in this study. 5-HT (EC50 = 1.5-2.0 nM) and sumatriptan (EC50 = 6-14 nM), a selective 5-HT1D agonist, produced dose-dependent inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in intact cells transfected with the 5-HT1D alpha or 5-HT1D beta receptor gene. The maximal inhibitory responses elicited by these agonists were slightly greater with the 5-HT1D alpha receptor (approximately 90%) than the 5-HT1D beta receptor (approximately 80%). 5-HT (EC50 = 1.7-2.4 nM) and sumatriptan (EC50 = 8-18 nM) also evoked dose-dependent elevations in intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i), with EC50 values that were indistinguishable from those for inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Cells expressing 5-HT1D beta receptors displayed significantly larger 5-HT-induced increases in [Ca2+]i than did cells expressing 5-HT1D alpha receptors (206 nM versus 114 nm increase; p < 0.01). Dose-dependent elevations in inositol phosphates (IP) were also observed after application of 5-HT (EC50 = 29-54 nM) or sumatriptan (EC50 = 73-481 nM); the maximal increases in IP accumulation were modest (51-69%) for both 5-HT1D subtypes. In contrast to the cAMP and calcium responses, the concentration-response curves for IP accumulation were shifted to the right at least 10-fold. Methiothepin, a nonselective 5-HT1 antagonist, competitively antagonized the cAMP response, yielding an apparent dissociation constant (Kb) of 3-4 nM for the 5-HT1D receptors. Methiothepin (10 microM) significantly reduced the elevations in [Ca2+]i (> 90%) and IP (> 75%) evoked by saturating concentrations (1 microM) of agonists. All three functional responses were significantly attenuated (> 90%) by pretreatment with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin. The sumatriptan-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i via activation of the 5-HT1D subtypes may provide a molecular mechanism of action by which sumatriptan could directly constrict cerebral blood vessels and alleviate migraine symptoms.\n",

      "PMID:  19444941\n",
      "Abs: Primary headaches such as migraine can be aborted by systemic administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), potentially through the non-selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity in the intracranial meninges. In this study we have used single and double labeling immunohistochemistry to examine the distribution of the COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms in the intracranial dura mater of the rat and identify cell types that express them. COX-1 immunoreactivity was found in medium and small dural blood vessels and was co-expressed with the endothelial cell markers vimentin and the endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase (ecNOS). COX-1 was also found to be present in most dural mast cells. COX-2 was mainly expressed in ED2-positive resident dural macrophages. Constitutive COX-2 expression was also found in some axonal profiles, many of which were co-labeled with the nociceptor peptide marker CGRP. The findings suggest that NSAIDs may abort headache, at least in part, by inhibiting either neuronal or non-neuronal COX activity in the dura mater.\n",

      "Title: Pre-treatment with new kynurenic acid amide dose-dependently prevents the nitroglycerine-induced neuronal activation and sensitization in cervical part of trigemino-cervical complex\n",
      "PMID:  24385076\n",
      "Abs: The systemic administration of nitroglycerine induces attacks in migraineurs and is able to activate and sensitize the trigeminal system in animals involving glutamate and α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, among others. Kynurenic acid is one of the endogenous glutamate receptor antagonists, and exerts inhibitory action on the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Since kynurenic acid penetrates the blood-brain barrier poorly, therefore a newly synthesized kynurenic acid amide, N-(2-N-pyrrolidinylethyl)-4-oxo-1H-quinoline-2-carboxamide hydrochloride (KYNAa) was used with such a side-chain substitution to facilitate brain penetration in our study. We evaluated its modulatory effect on kynurenic acid concentration in the cervical part of trigemino-cervical complex (C1-C2) and in the model of nitroglycerine-induced trigeminal activation using male Sprague-Dawley rats. One hour after 1 mmol/kg bodyweight KYNAa administration, the kynurenic acid level increased significantly in C1-C2, which returned to the basal level at 300 min measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. KYNAa pre-treatment had dose-dependent, mitigating action on nitroglycerine-induced decrease in calcitonin gene-related peptide and increase in c-Fos, neuronal nitric oxide synthase and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha expression in the C1-C2. KYNAa also mitigated the behavioural changes after nitroglycerine. Thus, in this model KYNAa is able to modulate in a dose-dependent manner the changes in neurochemical markers of activation and sensitization of the trigeminal system directly and indirectly--via forming kynurenic acid, possibly acting on peripheral and central glutamate or α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. These results suggest that application of kynurenic acid derivatives could be a useful therapeutic strategy in migraine headache in the future with a different mechanism of action.\n",

      "Title: The neuropeptide receptor calcitonin receptor-like (CALCRL) is a potential therapeutic target in acute myeloid leukemia\n",
      "PMID:  31182782\n",
      "Abs: Calcitonin receptor-like (CALCRL) is a G-protein-coupled neuropeptide receptor involved in the regulation of blood pressure, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and apoptosis, and is currently emerging as a novel target for the treatment of migraine. This study characterizes the role of CALCRL in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We analyzed CALCRL expression in collectively more than 1500 well-characterized AML patients from five international cohorts (AMLCG, HOVON, TCGA, Leucegene, and UKM) and evaluated associations with survival. In the AMLCG analytic cohort, increasing transcript levels of CALCRL were associated with decreasing complete remission rates (71.5%, 53.7%, 49.6% for low, intermediate, high CALCRL expression), 5-year overall (43.1%, 26.2%, 7.1%), and event-free survival (29.9%, 15.8%, 4.7%) (all P < 0.001). CALCRL levels remained associated with all endpoints on multivariable regression analyses. The prognostic impact was confirmed in all validation sets. Genes highly expressed in CALCRL(high) AML were significantly enriched in leukemic stem cell signatures and CALCRL levels were positively linked to the engraftment capacity of primary patient samples in immunocompromised mice. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of CALCRL significantly impaired colony formation in human myeloid leukemia cell lines. Overall, our study demonstrates that CALCRL predicts outcome beyond existing risk factors and is a potential therapeutic target in AML.\n",

      "PMID:  22245496\n",
      "Abs: The 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)7 receptor is the most recently identified serotonin receptor and is involved in a wide variety of central nervous system (CNS) functions, namely circadian rhythm, REM sleep, depression, thermoregulation, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety, schizophrenia, epilepsy, nociception, migraine, sensation-seeking behavior, impulsivity, learning and memory. These numerous (patho)physiological processes of the CNS, in which the 5-HT7 receptor is involved, most likely reflect a diverse set of signaling pathways arising from this receptor. In order to reveal new interaction partners and possibly new signaling and/or trafficking pathways, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening, using the C-terminal tail of the 5-HT7a receptor as bait and an adult-human brain cDNA library as prey. In this way we identified RhoBTB3 as a new interaction partner of the 5-HT7a receptor. By means of co-immunoprecipitation we were able to confirm the interaction between full length 5-HT7a receptor and RhoBTB3 in HEK293T cells. Subsequent domain mapping of this interaction revealed that not only the C-terminal tail, but also the third intracellular loop of the 5-HT7a receptor is involved. In addition, immunofluorescence microscopy showed clear co-localization between the 5-HT7a receptor and RhoBTB3 at the plasma membrane and in the endoplasmic reticulum. Despite the fact that RhoBTB3 has been shown to interact with Cul3, which in turn interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Roc1, we show here that RhoBTB3 neither recruits Cul3/Roc1 to the 5-HT7a receptor nor does it mediate ubiquitination of this receptor. Instead, we demonstrate that RhoBTB3 strongly inhibits proteasomal degradation of the 5-HT7a receptor.CI - Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Abs: Schimke Immuno-Osseous Dysplasia (SIOD) is an autosomal recessive multisystem disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the gene SMARCAL1. The clinical picture is characterized by spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia resulting in growth failure, nephropathy and T-cell deficiency. Neurologic manifestations include microcephaly, cognitive impairment, migraine-like headaches and cerebrovascular manifestations such as cerebral atherosclerotic vascular disease and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction. The role of SMARCAL1 deficiency in non-vascular neurological complications is still under debate. Epilepsy has been reported in a few patients, even in the absence of brain abnormalities. Data regarding electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns in SIOD are scarce METHODS: We describe the clinical, neuroradiological and EEG findings in two unrelated patients with SIOD showing a peculiar pseudo-periodic EEG pattern apparently not related to the cerebrovascular complications, since it was recognized both before and after cerebrovascular events CONCLUSION: Our observations support the hypothesis that SMARCAL1plays an important role in neurodevelopment and brain function and expand the spectrum of neurological abnormalities related to SIOD.CI - Copyright © 2020 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

      "PMID:  27792790\n",
      "Abs: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a nonatherosclerotic vascular disease leading to stenosis, dissection and aneurysm affecting mainly the renal and cerebrovascular arteries. FMD is often an underdiagnosed cause of hypertension and stroke, has higher prevalence in females (~80%) but its pathophysiology is unclear. We analyzed ~26K common variants (MAF>0.05) generated by exome-chip arrays in 249 FMD patients and 689 controls. We replicated 13 loci (P<10-4) in 402 cases and 2,537 controls and confirmed an association between FMD and a variant in the phosphatase and actin regulator 1 gene (PHACTR1). Three additional case control cohorts including 512 cases and 669 replicated this result and overall reached the genomic level of significance (OR = 1.39, P = 7.4×10-10, 1,154 cases and 3,895 controls). The top variant, rs9349379, is intronic to PHACTR1, a risk locus for coronary artery disease, migraine, and cervical artery dissection. The analyses of geometrical parameters of carotids from ~2,500 healthy volunteers indicate higher intima media thickness (P = 1.97×10-4) and wall to lumen ratio (P = 0.002) in rs9349379-A carriers, suggesting indices of carotid hypertrophy previously described in carotids of FMD patients. Immunohistochemistry detected PHACTR1 in endothelium and smooth muscle cells of FMD and normal human carotids. The expression of PHACTR1 by genotypes in primary human fibroblasts showed higher expression in rs9349379-A carriers (N = 86, P = 0.003). Phactr1 knockdown in zebrafish resulted in dilated vessels indicating subtle impaired vascular development. We report the first susceptibility locus for FMD and provide evidence for a complex genetic pattern of inheritance and indices of shared pathophysiology between FMD and other cardiovascular and neurovascular diseases.\n",

      "PMID:  24311292\n",
      "Abs: The human KCNK18 gene is predominantly expressed in brain, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglion neurons. Encoded K2P18.1K(+) channels are functionally implicated in migraine, pain and anesthesia. Data delineating the in vivo significance of K2P18.1 are still limited owing to a lack of model systems allowing for rapid, whole organism phenotypic analyses. We hypothesized that zebrafish (Danio rerio) might close this scientific gap. This work was designed to characterize the zebrafish ortholog of K2P18.1 in comparison to human K2P18.1 channels. The complete coding sequence of zKCNK18 was amplified from zebrafish cDNA. Zebrafish KCNK18 expression was assessed by in situ hybridization. Human and zebrafish K2P18.1 currents were functionally analyzed using two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology and the Xenopus oocyte expression system. KCNK18 mRNA is expressed in zebrafish brain and eyes. Human and zebrafish K2P18.1 proteins share 32 % identity. Zebrafish K2P18.1 channels mediate K(+)-selective background currents that stabilize the negative resting membrane potential. Functional similarities between human and zK2P18.1 currents include open rectification properties, inhibition by barium, and regulation by signaling molecules protein kinase (PK)C, PKA, and phospholipase C. In contrast to the human ortholog, zK2P18.1 exhibited reduced sensitivity to elevation of intracellular calcium levels by ionomycin and was virtually insensitive to inhibition by quinidine. Zebrafish and human K2P18.1 channels share functional and regulatory properties, indicating that the zebrafish may serve as model to assess K2P18.1 function in vivo. However, distinct differences in K2P18.1 current regulation require careful consideration when zebrafish data are extrapolated to human physiology.\n",

      "PMID:  21038416\n",
      "Abs: Sodium valproate (VPA) is widely used throughout the world to treat epilepsy, migraine, chronic headache, bipolar disorder, and as adjuvant chemotherapy. VPA toxicity is an uncommon but potentially fatal cause of idiosyncratic liver injury. Rare mutations in POLG, which codes for the mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ (polγ), cause Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome (AHS). AHS is a neurometabolic disorder associated with an increased risk of developing fatal VPA hepatotoxicity. We therefore set out to determine whether common genetic variants in POLG explain why some otherwise healthy individuals develop VPA hepatotoxicity. We carried out a prospective study of subjects enrolled in the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) from 2004 to 2008 through five US centers. POLG was sequenced and the functional consequences of VPA and novel POLG variants were evaluated in primary human cell lines and the yeast model system Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Heterozygous genetic variation in POLG was strongly associated with VPA-induced liver toxicity (odds ratio = 23.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 8.4-65.8, P = 5.1 × 10⁻⁷). This was principally due to the p.Q1236H substitution which compromised polγ function in yeast. Therapeutic doses of VPA inhibited human cellular proliferation and high doses caused nonapoptotic cell death, which was not mediated through mitochondrial DNA depletion, mutation, or a defect of fatty acid metabolism. CONCLUSION: These findings implicate impaired liver regeneration in VPA toxicity and show that prospective genetic testing of POLG will identify individuals at high risk of this potentially fatal consequence of treatment.\n",
