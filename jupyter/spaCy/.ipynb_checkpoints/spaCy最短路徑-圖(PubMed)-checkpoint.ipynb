By 12 months, however, diabetics had developed neurone perikaryal and distal axon atrophy, accompanied by generalized downregulation of mRNA expression, particularly of CGRP transcripts, PACAP, SP, NFM, p75, trkA and trkC. With the exception of HSP-27, no elevation in mRNAs that increase after injury, such as VIP, galanin, CCK, PACAP, B50 and t alpha 1-tubulin, was observed and constitutive levels, when detectable, trended towards lower rather than increased levels.\n",
